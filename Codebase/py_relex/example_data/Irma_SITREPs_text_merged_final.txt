The extent of the devastation to Cuba and islands in the Eastern Caribbean is beginning to become clearer as rapid assessments are underway.  With high winds, heavy rain and storm surges, Irma caused widespread damage to homes, schools, health centers and basic infrastructure across the region. Hurricane Irma put 2.4 million children at risk ; of these 271,000 were directly affected . Each island affected in the Eastern Caribbean has a different set of needs, with WASH, Child Protection and Education being priorities . Thousands of children are having their education disrupted, as schools across Cuba, Turks and Caicos islands, British Virgin Islands, Anguilla and Barbuda are damaged. This also raises child protection concerns. Supply needs are being identified, mainly education materials, hygiene kits, jerry cans and tarpaulins. UNICEF is taking part in multi-partner assessments across the region. Psycho - social support activities are underway in the Eastern Caribbean. UNICEF continues to use U - Report to send and receive vital information to 13,500 people across the region.

Situation Overview Needs assessments are underway across all the islands affected by Hurricane Irma, a category five hurricane that hit the Caribbean between Wednesday - Sunday, 6 - 10 September , before moving on to cause further destruction in Florida . Damage has been confirmed in Anguilla , Barbuda , British Virgin Islands (BVI), St Maarten /St Martin (both Dutch and French sides of the island), US Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos, Cuba and the Bahamas . While the impact was lower than originally feared in Haiti and the Dominican Republic , needs assessments are still underway. UNICEF staff are on the ground, working in close coordination with each government and implementing partners , evaluating the most urgent needs for children and adolescents. Humanitarian Leadership and Coordination National response to the emergency is led by each National Government and their respective sectoral Ministries . UNICEF CO s continue to actively participate in coordination meetings and provide technical assistance. o In Cuba, a CERF request is being coordinated with the government and the UNCT with a focus on Education and WASH . This will include early childhood development and recreation activities. o UNICEF Eastern Caribbean Office is fully engaged with the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) response mechanism to conduct the first rapid needs assessment. o UNICEF Dominican Republic, as a part of UNETE, has offered support to the Government , and the WASH Group has been activated in the capital and in the northern region of the country. UNICEF could also request CERF , depending on the assessment of the humanitarian impact. UNICEF LACRO has taken part in regional coordination meetings led by OCHA where sector actions and operation mechanisms for the response are being analyzed and agreed upon. OCHA has announced the intention to prepare a Regional Response Plan for some of the countries affected by the Hurricane. UNICEF Eastern Caribbean Office is coordinating closely with all local authorities, including those of the affected British Overseas Territories , which are considered under the Eastern Caribbean Multi - Country Programme (British Virgin Islands, Turks & Caicos Islands and Anguilla). The islands that are part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and part of France are receiving direct support from the governments of The Netherlands and of France. Where requested, UNICEF L ACRO is providing advice to the UNICEF NatComs. Summary Analysis by CO Cuba Hurricane Irma spent 72 hours over Cuba, causing different levels of damage to in various parts of the island. It initially hit the area between Guantanamo and Las Tunas. Despite lots of wind, there was no serious impact during the first hours , but Irma maintained its strength and slowed its pace while travelling over the north coast, causing high impact, especially on houses and telecommunications. In the Central Region, many areas that focus on fishing, agriculture and tourism have been impacted. Irma spent 12 hours around Villa Clara , causing large - scale destruction in Ciego de Avila, Sancti Spiritus, Villa Clara and Camaguey. There is a possible impact on food security , as the affected area contain s 80% of all cattle and more than 11,000 hectares of staple food plantations , all of which were affected. Flooding has affected the coastal areas of Matanzas, Mayabeque and La Havana. Many areas of Havana remain without power, while water supplies are beginning to be restored. The airport was closed until Wednesday. There is likely to be a need for housing reconstruction and rehabilitation of hospitals and educational cent re s in many areas, although this falls outside rea of responsibility . 1. Cuba: Initial estimates provided by OCHA and Cuba CO. 2. DR: These estimates indicate the general population and children who are living in poverty and with high level of vulnerability to climate shock in the most affected provinces in the north (Samaná, Puerto Plata, Montecristi and María Trinidad Sánchez). 3. ECA: ECA Humanitarian Situation Report #5 . 4. Haiti: Estimates provided by Civil Protection Department. After the conversation with the CO, we anticipate that this number may rise again as assessment of water systems are completed. . Estimated Affected Population ( Estimates calculated based on initial figures from UNICEF Country Offices. 14 September 2017 ) Country Office Estimated number of affected people Estimated number of affected children Cuba [1] 900,000 171,000 Dominican Republic [2] 178,700 62,500 ECA [3] 73,760 19,213 Haiti [4] 45,000 18,932 TOTAL 1,197,460 271,645 UNICEF CO Response UNICEF plans a similar response to Hurricane Irma as the one implemented for Hurricane Matthew but in more municipalities. UNICEF has identified WASH as a priority area. UNICEF will be providing chlorine tablets, jerry cans, hygiene kits and hygiene messaging. The CERF request draft is being finalized , focusing on WASH and education and specific supplies to supp ort early childhood development, socio - emotional and recreation activities . UNICEF plans to work with UNESCO and WHO on Return to Happiness programmes. It is exploring the possibility of expanding its child protection role to include Return to School and Return to Protective Environment programmes as part of education. UNICEF is developing a supply plan for all sector needs to be shared. Current identified supplies include 1 whole container of jerry cans , 100 school in box kits 90 recreation kits , and 50 ECD kits . Gaps and needs Communication has been difficult. Telecommunications have been badly affected. Stand - by partners with telecommunication expertise are available if needed . There have been fuel shortages, but power should be back running by the end of the week . UNICEF staff are also facing personal consequences of Irma, with lack of water and other basic services in their homes. UNICEF does not have the capacity to respond to all 14 municipalities affected. CO is currently looking to respond to eight municipalities . Thirteen out of the 15 warehouses that were available in the provinces have been damaged , making it difficult to store and distribute supplies. No UNICEF supplies have been lost or damaged. A communications plan is lacking; external communication is difficult, as everything needs to be Government approved. Dominican Republic (DR) The damage to the Dominican Republic was far less than expected , with no fatalities reported. However, a large number of people have been displaced in the north of the country. School classes (public and private) restarted on Monday , 11 September and the majority of displaced people have returned to their homes . Although the damage has not been large, the situation for children must be monitored, especially regarding basic water and sanitation services for children. UNICEF CO Response Needs assessment missions were completed this week in the north of the country, and the humanitarian needs will largely be met by national authorities. While UNICEF will provide technical and specific small - scale support, the CO will not be requesting additional funding . Eastern Caribbean Islands Area (ECA) A large number of the Eastern Caribbean islands have been battered by Hurricane Irma. Six fatalities have been confirmed, though this figure may rise. Barbuda and Tortola and South Caicos in TVI report especially high damage. The majority of inhabitants of Barbuda , which was almost completely destroyed by Irma, are in Antigua , and despite school restarting today in Antigua, children from Barbuda were not eligible to attend . Telecommunications, power supply and water systems in Anguilla, BVI and TCI remain down. Many of the islands relied on bottled water before Irma hit, and some bottling plants have been affected. The plant in Anguilla is now fully operational, but the plant in South Caicos remains closed. Shelter, food and water for the multiple islands is crucial. Air access to the islands has begun to resume. There we re reports of looting, and curfews have been put in place on some islands. The damage to school infrastructure greatly jeopardizes access to education for affected children. It is estimated that in all the islands, 19,200 children - of whom 5,500 are under five - are deprived of access to safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene and safety, and 15,000 children and adolescents are in need of psycho - social support and protective environment. UNICEF CO Response Children from the islands of Anguilla, BVI , TCI and Barbuda remain a UNICEF priority. 1,900 children and adolescents are to be reached by UNICEF psycho - social support and educational activities in Anguilla, Barbuda, BVI and TCI. UNICEF is part of the 22 - strong UN Rapid Assessment and Response Teams gathering information for Turks and Caicos Islands . UNICEF took part in t wo site visits made to the National Technical Training Cent re and Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Ground (Stadium) in Antigua. A joint visit will be made on Thursday to the other sites hosting evacuees in coordination with the Ministry of Social Protection. UNICEF has identified a need to provide school bags for children from Barbuda in Antigua. UNICEF has also identified that families staying with friends and family in Antigua may not be accessing services. To support the return to normalcy for children in the four affected countries, UNICEF has been working with partners on the ground to identify and respond to the most immediate needs. Pre - positioned supplies in Antigua are being distributed to affected populations that were evacuated from Barbuda. Supplies from Barbados are being shipped north. The supplies being immediately ordered are: o Water tanks (1,000l) to reach 69 schools/shelters to benefit approximately 7,700 children (+6 y ears old ) ; o 193 ECD Kits for 193 communities to benefit 5,786 children (0 - 6 y ears old ) ; o 309 school - in - a - box Kits for 309 communities to ben e fit 12,340 children (+6 y ears old ) ; o 135 recreation activities to benefit more than 12,340 children (+6 y ears old ) ; o 69 tents for 64 communities to benefit 7,394 children (+6 y ears old ). Pre - positioned supplies in Antigua are being distributed to the affected population evacuated from Barbuda to Antigua and supplies from Barbados emergency stocks are being shipped north . Return to Happiness activities are to start in Antigua on 14 September for Barbuda evacuees in the largest shelter in the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. Psychosocial support for children started on 12 September in Barbuda, an d a further request has been received from TCI. The UNICEF team reports near total devastation in South Caicos , where 200 families will need to be evacuated. Education plays a key role during emergency situations , so UNICEF and partners will mobilize all the possible resources in order to accelerate the return to school for the affected child populations. Students in Antigua returned to school on 11 September. All six primary schools in Anguilla have been badly damaged and school may not restart until 1 October. C4D : UNICEF is using C4D strategies and tools to guarantee that all children and adolescents living in the affected areas are protected, healthy and have access to education and participation spaces. o Key messages sent via social media, WhatsApp and via traditional media; o C4D plan in place covering education, child protection and health ; o Radio spots on health and child protection broadcast; o C4D questions integrated into the assessment tool that will be used by actors on the ground during the initial assessment ; o 1,000 copies of communication materials produced (checklist for parent before an emergency, handwashing poster and flyer, tips for keeping your children safe after a disaster, prevent Zika & dengue after flooding, radio ads have been distributed). EPF and Thematic Funds are being sought from EMOPS , while private fundraising in LACRO has been initiated by LACR O. UNICEF continues to advocate for the rejection of donations of powdered baby milk. Gaps and needs UNICEF WASH: for shelters, UNICEF will ensure adequate gender segregated sanitation and bathing facilities, with cleaning supply materials and family hygiene kits. Supply needs have been identified for Anguilla: 10,000 water cases, 200 tarpaulins , 200 water containers, 500 cleaning k its, 1 0,000 units of mosquito repellent, 5,000 hygiene kits, 5,000 food kits, 10,000 baby kits, 10,000 first a id k its, and 40 tents for shelter . In BVI , the supply needs identified include: tarpaulins, water jugs, water purification tablets, towels, blankets diapers, and medicines . In TVI , the supply needs identified include: emergency relief supplies, food for the entire population, tarpaulins , water supplies, mosquito repellant, shelter facilities and generators . Access to shelter, places in schools, and access to healthcare is required in Antigua . The security situation is critical in St Maarten (Dutch side) , which is being described as a war zone. There has been looting in the streets and persons have been reported to be walking around with guns and machetes. The main support priorities for UNICEF are protection for the most vulnerable children and adolescents, psycho - social support to the most affected children and adolescents, water/sanitation and hygiene promotion, re - establishment of education in the education system , including early childhood development as the main protective environment, along with participation and engagement of families and children and adolescents in the recovery efforts. In South Caicos , there are a number of undocumented Haitian and Dominican Republic nationals. These families are vulnerable and report having no access to cash. UNICEF has identified the need for an Engineer/Architect to evaluate the infrastructure of schools that were damaged. Haiti The most exposed areas of Haiti to the effects of Hurricane Irma are the three northern departments of North West, North and North East. Centre and Artibonite, which are prone to flooding, are also affected but to a lesser degree. A small number of schools have been reported as damaged and/or have lost materials. Schools reopened on 12 September in North East. While there are concerns about diarrheal diseases such as cholera, no increase in cases has been reported to date. In North East , 1,600 families were housed in temporary shelters for 72 hours in 12 shelters ; these shelters are now closed. In addition, two children have been reported missing in North East. In North West , 840 people were housed in temporary shelters in Anse à Foleur, which was the most badly affected area ; these are now in the process of being closed. In North West , there are reports of very few houses destroyed, and the majority of those that have been damaged are being repaired by their owners. UNICEF CO Response Damage assessment is underway. As of 11 September, there is one reported death, one missing person and 17 injured. 12,539 people have been evacuated and 81 official shelters are open. 2,646 houses are described as severely damaged, with 466 destroyed and 4 ,903 flooded. A total of 8,015 families, which equals 45,000 people, are reported to be affected. This number may rise as assessments of water systems are completed. Continuous surveillance and rapid response to cholera alerts continues , focusing on access to clean water and sanitation in the most affected areas , as well as through strengthening community based surveillance. No disease upsurge has been observed so far . UNICEF supports three OXFAM teams covering North and North East via direct logistics to MSPP mobile teams and two teams in North West . In North East , the contingency PCA with Oxfam was activated , and through this , UNICEF has undertaken an evaluation of affected water points , especially a mapping of all the wells which have been flooded in the neighborhoods of Ouanaminthe in order to plan their disinfection as soon as possible . In North East , two emergency water distribution systems have been installed, six hand washing stations and three chlorination points in shelters , while door to door hygiene activities are underway alongside the distribution of Aquatabs in Caracol and Ferrier. In the North, North East and Artibonite departments , eight bladders were installed in the main temporary shelters by UNICEF partners in support to DINEPA. In North West , UNICEF has provided technical assistance to DINEPA Rural Department Unit to support the rapid assessment of water systems in Sauval, Ka - Luc a Mahotiere, Calife and Anse à Foleur . In Nutrition, stocks of plumpy nut were prepositioned in the Northern departments (Artibonite: 770 boxes, North West: 1,300 boxes, North East: 200 boxes and Nor th : 110 boxes) prior to Hurricane Irma and are currently being used by the health structures. A rapid evaluation is on - going by UNICEF partner FONDEFH in the North and North East. All 242 children in institutions at risk of being flooded or damage d by the hurricane and who were relocated to safe locations have now return ed to their facilities. Support to Education Departmental Directorate in the North East was provided to assess all affected schools . UNICEF now assisting in cleaning buildings to facilitate schools reopening . S chool kit distribution is planned for around 80 public schools (around 25,000 children) in North and North East as part of UNICEF regular program . Quantities of kits will be adapted to accommodate additional needs as required. Gaps and needs A m meeting is required to ensure coordination in WASH intervention in affected communities in North East and Artibonite. Partial repair to water supply is required in Sauval de Jean Rabel , Anse a Foleur and La Chappelle. A need for hygiene kits, school kits and school furniture ha s been identified in North East. Cash transfer needs are r required for vulnerable families. UNICEF Protection team held a meeting with the leader of IBESR (Social Services) in North to highlight the need to monitor vulnerable families that have been affected by Hurricane Irma at the community level . According to IBESR , the number of cases of separated children in multisector evaluations have not been verified. Regional Actions include: UNICEF RO is supporting . UNICEF Regional Office has been communicating with all COs affected to provide technical assistance, tools and reference materials for response preparation. o Education: School Security Index to assess the infrastructure of damaged schools in ECA ; ECA CO support in identifying specialists for the implementation of R return to H happiness, revision of drafts of regional response plan and inclusion of inputs for child protection ; support to Haiti in its follow - up actions to prevent family separation and to identify specialists for the coordination of the cluster for two months. o Health, Nutrition and WASH: Work with the C4D team to prepare key messages on health, nutrition and WASH to be disseminated through U - Report to the Caribbean countries; in response to CDEMA reporting that countries have ask ed for baby formula as part of their list of urgent supplies, UNICEF has drafted a message on the importance of protecting breastfeeding and to avoid donation s and the distribution of breast - milk substitutes . o Child Protection: ECA CO support to identify specialists in the implementation of Return to Happiness, revision of drafts of regional response plan and inclusion of inputs for child protection ; support to Haiti in its follow - up actions to prevent family separation and the identification of specialists to coordinate the cluster for two months ; support to Cuba in the revision of CERF draft to incorporate socio-emotional activities in education. o Gender: Support to COs on key gender elements to include in on - going assessments and sectoral priorities as required.

Note that Kansas has not declared a State of Emergency, however is using its resources to assist states affected by Harvey. These declarations automatically waive select Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs), including hours -of-service (HOS) regulations, for motor carriers hauling resources to aid in restoration efforts. The declarations exempt FCMSR in every state along the motor carriers route as long as the final destination is with the declared disaster areas.  Some HOS waivers apply specifically to the movement of petroleum products in or through the state. In addition, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) issued a Regional Emergency Declaration for Hurricane Harvey exempting FMCSRs in the States of Texas and Louisiana. On August 31, the FMCSA expanded the Regional Emergency Declaration to additional states and Washington, DC. On September 6, the Regional Emergency Declaration was extended for states affected by Hurricane Irma.

SITUATION REPORT September 9, 2017 Page 12 of 12 On September 8, 2017, PHMSA issued an Emergency Waiver Order under 49 U.S.C. 5103 to persons conducting operations under the direction of the U.S. EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard that support appropriate actions to prepare for, respond to, and recover from a threat to public health, welfare, or the environment caused by actual or potential oil and hazardous materials incidents resulting from Hurricane Irma in Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Florida, and South Carolina. A Stafford Act declaration was made for Puerto Rico and Florida on September 5, 2017, and for South Carolina on September 7, 2017. On September 1, PHMSA issued an Emergency Stay of Enforcements for operators affected by Hurricane Harvey. The declaration state s that PHMSA does not intend to take any enforcement action relating to their noncompliance with certain operator qualification requirements, or pre -employment and random drug testing requirements, arising from the use of personnel for pipeline activities related to response and recovery. On September 7, PHMSA issued an enforcement stay for the waiver to include states affected by Hurricane Irma. The states included in this extension are Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Puerto Rico. On September 5, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved an emergency waiver tariff, effective immediately, allowing the pipeline system to accept 11.5 RVP gasoline (A3) to fill nominations for 7.8 RVP gasoline (A1) and 9.0 RVP gasoline (A2); and to ship conventional gasoline in lieu of reformulated gasoline. Colonials tariffs and tariff practices would not normally permit it to accept product that does not conform to the specifications of the product that was nominated.

On September 10, 2017, based on a Stafford act emergency declaration, PHMSA amended this order to include Georgia. On September 1, PHMSA issued an Emergency Stay of Enforcements for operators affected by Hurricane Harvey. The declaration states that PHMSA does not intend to take any enforcement action relating to their noncompliance with certain operator qualification requirements, or pre -employment and random drug testing requirements, arising from the use of personnel for pipeline activities related to response and recovery. On September 7, PHMSA issued an enforcement stay for the waiver to include states affected by Hurricane Irma. The states included in this extension are Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Puerto Rico. On September 5, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved an emergency waiver tariff, effective immediately, allowing the pipeline system to accept 11.5 RVP gasoline (A3) to fill nominations for 7.8 RVP gasoline (A1) and 9.0 RVP gasoline (A2); and to ship conventional gasoline in lieu of reformulated gasoline. Colonials tariffs and tariff practices would not normally permit it to accept product that does not conform to the specifications of the product that was nominated.

Note that Kansas has not declared a State of Emergency, however is using its resources to assist states affected by Harvey. These declarations automatically waive select Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs), including hours -of-service (HOS) regulations, for motor carriers hauling resources to aid in restoration efforts. The declarations exempt FCMSR in every state along the motor carriers route as long as the final destination is with the declared disaster areas.  Some HOS waivers apply specifically to the movement of petroleum products in or through the state. In addition, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) issued a Regional Emergency Declaration for Hurricane Harvey exempting FMCSRs in the States of Texas and Louisiana. On August 31, the FMCSA expanded the Regional Emergency Declaration to additional states and Washington, DC. On September 6, the Regional Emergency Declaration was extended for states affected by Hurricane Irma. On September 7, the Irma Regional Declaration was expanded again to include states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. On September 11, an Amended Regional Declaration of Emergency was released that extended the exemption of FMCSRs in all 27 states and Washington D.C. through September 30, 2017, or the end of the emergency as defined.

Note that Kansas has not declared a State of Emergency, however is using its resources to assist states affected by Harvey. These declarations automatically waive select Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs), including hours -of-service (HOS) regulations, for motor carriers hauling resources to aid in restoration efforts. The declarations exempt FCMSR in every state along the motor carriers route as long as the final destination is with the declared disaster areas.  Some HOS waivers apply specifically to the movement of petroleum products in or through the state. In addition, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) issued a Regional Emergency Declaration for Hurricane Harvey exempting FMCSRs in the States of Texas and Louisiana. On August 31, the FMCSA expanded the Regional Emergency Declaration to additional states and Washington, DC. On September 6, the Regional Emergency Declaration was extended for states affected by Hurricane Irma. On September 7, the Irma Regional Declaration was expanded again to include states in the Mid -Atlantic and Northeast. On September 11, an Amended Regional Declaration of Emergency was released that extended the exemption of FMCSRs in all 27 states and Washington D.C. through September 30, 2017, or the end of the emergency as defined.

Estimates from International Federation of the Red Cross available at https://goo.gl/mkF83A ] Humanitarian Preparedness and Response The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) continues to monitor the system Regional Coordination Center (RCC) are fully active. The CARICOM Disaster Relief Unit (CDRU), Disaster Assessment and Coordination (CDAC) team and Operational Support Team (COST) are also on standby. The National Emergency Operations Centers (COE) are active in several Caribbean countries and remain on alert in the different ports and marinas to prevent human and material losses. Humanitarian regional partners are monitoring the situation and are in contact with their sub - offices in the Caribbean. CDEMA requested OCHA to deploy UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) teams to assist in initial needs assessment, coordination of the response and information management. There are concerns that humanitarian partners have a limited presence in the northern regions of Haiti where Irma is expected to hit harder possibly resulting in flash floods and landslides in a country a visit to the North trying to ensure preparedness actions are underway. ECHO and DFID are also pre - positioning their staff in the Dominican Republic and Jamaica to ensure that they will have deeper access to the affected regions. IFRC stated that they have mobilized 60,000 Swiss francs to the national Red Cross Societies in Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts and N evis. They are working on requests for the Dominican Republic and Haiti. UN Environment has produced hazard impact tables which identify industrial plants, chemical facilities, and the presence of other potentially noxious or toxic pollutants which could pose a threat. So far UN Environment has information from Antigua, Barbuda and Turks & Caicos, but it is continuing to map information in the northern part of the Dominican Republic, Haiti, St Kitts & Nevis. Barbados with first assessment teams. Four additional technical staff (Education and Child Protection) are on standby to accompany additional CDEMA assessment missions to islands. 4 Logistics Damages and Needs: Dutch Saint Martin airport closed. Antigua airport re - opening 7 September Response: Humanitarian regional partners have supplies available in the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD) in Panama. UNHRD informs that the best way to send supplies is by air. They are prepared and it will take 24 - 48 hours to prepare a charter flight. The Spanish Agency for International Cooperation for Development ( AECID) has reported that it has stocks of relief supplies in Madrid, Spain, and is ready to mobilize in case if required Global logistics cluster had airlift capacity into Port - au - Prince, Haiti, and a flight departed on 6 September from Dubai. Contact person at UNHRD in Panama: Francisco Quesada ( francisco.quesada@wfp.org ) Health Damages and Needs: There is a growing concern that treatment of cholera in western Haiti could be affected by Irma as the treatment centres in that part of Haiti are essentially makeshift. The centres are being deactivated and population is getting the needed assistance at the hospitals. However, hospitals in the West Department present functional problems, so a group of epidemiologists have been activated to monitor the situation in the northern zone in close coordination with the Ministry of Health. Response: PAHO/WHO have pre - deployed staff to the Turks and Caicos Islands and to the Bahamas. Three staff members have been stationed in Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla and in St Kitts/Nevis. The Washington office has been assisting and supporting with monitoring and providing update Disaster Coordinators. Teams are on stand by and the areas of focus include Coordination, Logistics, Water and Sanitation, Damage Assessment and Information Management. Health engineer s have been reported as needed.

UNICEF reports that a minimum of 5,000 liters of safe drinking water is required to be provided to persons in shelters in Antigua, with additional quantities for general sanitation and hygiene. There is concern that the contamination and salinization of clean water supplies on affected islands will present major health needs. Response (Eastern Caribbean): Water purifications tablets were given to the National Emergency Office in Antigua for Barbuda evacuees. In addition, UNICEF pre-positioned emergency supplies in Antigua (tents, tarpaulins, water purification tables, etc.) have been distributed in coordination with national authorities. A UNICEF WASH Specialist was deployed to Barbuda and Antigua to conduct an initial needs assessment as a part of the UNDAC team for Anguilla. In addition, two UNICEF ECA Specialists have been deployed to Turks & Caicos Islands and one to BVI. More than 3,000 flyers have been produced with key messages on handwashing and Child Protection to be distributed within the next days. In addition, UNICEF has produced radio spots on health, hygiene, breastfeeding and child protection in emergencies. Teams from the non -affected islands are being mobilized for psychosocial care and support activities in partnership with the Organization of the Eastern Caribbean Office. The first group of children to benefit from this effort will be evacuees from Barbuda based in Antigua. Shelter and WASH supplies are being mobilized to TCI where the impact is reported to be very high, given the low -lying islands Damages and Needs (Western Caribbean )   Coastal flooding in Cuba, damage to sanitation facilities, and the flooding of streams and rivers have caused the contamination of cisterns throughout the northern coast of affected municipalities. In Havana, power outages continue to affect water pumping and supply. In the Dominican Republic, the National Water Institute (INAPA) states that 30 aqueducts were affected, directly affecting the drinking water service for 1,236,860 people, or about 12 per cent of the countrys population. Initial estimates c all for the distribution of 3,000 hygiene kits, 5,000 plastic jerry cans and 100 water tanks for the affected population, as well as 30,000 ORS in preparation for an increase in diarrhea cases. Response (Western Caribbean) UNICEF has allocated 3 million chlorine tablets have been for distribution to 40 -50,000 people. UNICEF WASH LAC is coordinating the response with WASH Group in DR and PAHO and advising on needed supplies to respond to the first phase of the emergency in Cuba. Water quality and inadequate hygiene habits due to lack of access to basic and adequate WASH services are concerns. Prior to the arrival of the hurricane, UNICEF, with the Emergency Operations Center, disseminated key messages about preparedness through social media networks. As of September 6, these messages have been seen 18 million times. Through the nutrition resilience group, UNICEF has called on humanitarian partners to avoid the distribution of baby formula and other substitutes for breast milk. As a part of the disaster preparedness actions with the MoE, a guidance has been provided to teachers and psychologists in schools to effectively deal with children affected by the emergency.

Contact person at OIM in Panama: Luz Tantaruna ( ltantaruna@iom.int ) and contact person at IFRC Regional Office for the Americas in Panama: Inigo Barrena ( ci.barrena@ifrc.org )    CAMP COORDINATION CAMP MANAGEMENT Damages and Needs (General) Hurricane aftermath includes displacement both internal and cross border (preemptive evacuations and evacuations as a response). The impact of displacement numbers must be assessed against initial demographics and population exposure, for instance some islands have had 100% of population displaced cross island such as Crooked Island in Bahamas and Barbuda in Eastern Caribbean. Some islands are at present hardly able to sustain habitation indicating prolonged displacement perspectives whether it is in temporary collective sites or in other type of hosting arrangements. Temporary sites where persons have been evacuated to or are taking shelter having found no alternative solutions need urgent repairs and the living conditions improved as well for the coming weeks. Response (General) IOM has deployed a six strong surge team to the Eastern Caribbean, Panama and to Bahamas / TCI to provide support to CDEMA and local emergency management agencies such as National Office of Disaster Services (NODS) in Antigua .  Expertise includes CCCM sector coordination, Displacement Tracking Matrix, shelter management and GBV risk reduction and IM officers. Displacement tracking is under way to provide working figures for planning the response and monitor the evolution of needs and humanitarian gaps. Geoportal is being developed and updated as data becomes available. On-going assessments with CDEMA, UNDAC, NODS and FACT, DART, CDAT teams and local partners. Education Damages and Needs (Eastern Caribbean): UNICEF estimates an alarming number of schools potentially affected in Anguilla, Barbuda, BVI Response (Eastern Caribbean): A UNICEF Rapid Response Team has been deployed in Antigua Island to ensure rapid and efficient operations for BVI, Anguilla and Barbuda, while TCI response will continue to be handled from Barbados CO. Country Emergency Situation Report No. XX | 12  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Coordination Saves Lives | www.unocha.org Damages and Needs (Western Caribbean): +80,000 potentially affected children in Cuba, with 255,000 at risk UNICEF cites serious school damage to TCI Islands. Response (Western Caribbean )  UNICEF Rapid assessments are underway in Haiti to understand needs and the number of children who need aid. Contact person at UNICEF in Panama: Douglas Reimer ( dreimer@unicef.org ) Early Recovery Damages and Needs (Eastern Caribbean): Livelihoods, housing and infrastructure in Anguilla, Barbuda, the British Virgin Islands, St. Martin/St. Maarten, are severely affected. The complete extent of the damage to the southern islands of the Bahamas and the entirety of Turks and Caicos is unclear. Response (Eastern Caribbean): UNDP offices in the Caribbean have joined forces in a Regional Recovery Strategy for Irma -affected Small Island Developing States. This includes debris and waste removal, immediate short -term employment for affected women and men and community infrastructure rehabilitation. The strategy will be developed and implemented in support of and upon request from national authorities, coordinated by UNDP in Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados, which also cover several other island states. UNDP is coordinating with humanitarian partners to ensure the coherent implementation of a short, medium and long term programme that will enable affected communities in the Caribbean to build back betterﬂ leaving no one behind. UNDP personnel from Barbados will deploy to Antigua to coordinate relief package and response UNHCR is mobilizing support for livelihoods programming and early recovery in Antigua and Barbuda through the Antigua and Barbuda Red Cross, which is working in coordination with the government and its National Office of Disaster Services (NODS). Damages and Needs (Western Caribbean): Damage to housing and infrastructure in Turks and Caicos is expected to be significant. In the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Haiti, the hurricane affected the livelihoods in communities exposed to the storms path, directly affecting women, men and children, as well as income -generating activities such as agriculture, fisheries and small and medium enterprises. National authorities in the Dominican Republic are still assessing all damages and needs. According to UNDP, the vulnerable population in affected areas of the Dominican Republic has specific needs, compared to the rest of the population, and requires adequate responses. In Cuba, UNDP is distributing 9,823 pre -positioned roofing ceilings in accordance with the indications provided by national authorities, as well as tarpaulins to create temporary facilities for affected populations. Two UNDP experts will be arriving between 13 and 14 September to support the UNDP Office in their response for Cuba. Contact person at UNDP in New York: Ugo Blanco ( ugo.blanco@undp.org) Funding Regional Response Plan OCHA and humanitarian partners are currently working on a 3 -month regional response plan (RRP ) for the period September to December that lays out the priorities of international humanitarian agencies (UN and NGOs and IFRC), working closely with national Governments and regional counterparts in particular CDEMA. Country Emergency Situation Report No. XX | 13  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Coordination Saves Lives | www.unocha.org In order to include as many partners as possible, particularly non -UN, participating organizations should identify planned partners and include them in the RRP. As with other emergency response funding, the RRP will have to use projections and estimations based on preliminary data - the RRP allows flexibility and can be revised in a few weeks time when assessment information is complete. The plan will be shared through OCHA partnerships (IASC, OCHA Permanent Missions in Geneva and New York and other partners). The RRP is structured to focus on emergency support to the most vulnerable people (includes: health, food security, protection, wash, education and shelter), logistics and communication, and coordination and technical support (includes early recovery). For additional guidance on the RRP, contact Amaia Lopez at OCHA ROLAC (lopez20@un.org ) Emergency Funding (as of 13 September) Several organizations have already activated emergency funding mechanisms and agreements or are actively pursuing the release of emergency funding.

Irma made landfall on northeast Caribbean islands during the early hours of 6 September, affecting Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, British Virgin Islands , Cuba, St. Martin, the British Virgin Islands and other islands in the Caribbean . Since then, thousands of people have been evacuated from at -risk areas and different level of impact reported from the affected areas. www.unocha.org The mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to mobilize and coordinate effective and principled humanitarian action in partnership with national and international actors. Coordination Saves Lives + For more information, see ﬁbackground on the crisisﬂ at the end of the report The Caribbean : Hurricane Irma Situation Report No. 6 (as of 15 September 2017 )   This report is produced by OCHA ROLAC in collaboration with humanitarian partners. It covers the first period from 06 to 15 September, 2017. The next report will be issue d on or around 19 September 2017. Highlights Shortage of food and potable water in Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, the British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos - some of the most affected by Hurricane Irma continues to be of concern. A Regional Response Plan (RRP) to raise US$ 27 million to address the urgent needs of the most vulnerable people affected by Hurricane Irma was launched on 15 September. Severely limited communications are hampering the coordination of relief supplies in Turks and Caicos and increasing anxiety among people. In the after math of Irma, Cuban provinces with a population of 2.3 million people are dealing with a disrupted supply of power. The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) has indicated that cash donations through its Emergency Assistance Fund (EAF) will help purchase relief items locally and help to re -start the local economy. US$ 27 million needed for assistance via the Regional Response plan 265,000 estimated to have been affected by Irma in the Caribbean. 19,200 children in the Eastern Caribbean with limited access to potable water 10,000 Hectares of food production damaged in Cuba 92% of the buildings in Sint Maarten damaged by Hurricane Irma Situation Overview Humanitarian response to assist the most vulnerable people affected by Hurricane Irma is in high gear. However, as communications and logistics continue to be impaired in many of the islands that faced the fiercest onslaught of Irma, response efforts face challenges. Of particular concern is the situation in Turks and Caicos, where severely limited communications is not only hampering the coordination of relief supplies, rumours and incomplete information is undermining planned distribution of relief assistance. A significant number of communities remain without water and power in Cuba. The Government is working towards restoring electricity in 13 of its 15 provinces most affected by Irma. However, Matanzas, Sancti Spiritus, Villa Clara, Ciego de Avila provinces, with 2.3 million inhabitants, have reported the most significant problems with power supply. The Government is supplying water through tankers and making food available at subsidised prices in the affected areas .  Residents of the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla continue to battle with an impaired supply of water and electricity .  Anguilla. Photo taken during UNDAC rapid assessments / PHOTO: UNDAC Regional Situation Report No. 6 | 2  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Coordination Saves Lives | www.unocha.org Canned food and milk, particularly for babies and water are priority needs in Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands, according to CDEMA. Roads and communications remain affected in Barbuda. According to the Antigua and Barbuda Red Cross it will take between six to eight weeks to restore electricity, communications and water to Barbuda .  Shelters in the British Virgin Islands are running out of space and several unofficial shelters are now accommodating people left homeless. Medica l services have also been considerably impacted with the only hospital in the islands partially operational. Incoming relief supplies and personnel must be cleared with the Anguilla National Emergency Operation Centre to adequately plan for logistics or will be denied entry. Despite the shortcomings, in many instances the humanitarian community has been proactive. Even though information is still coming in from the most affected islands, humanitarian actors have deployed pre -positioned personnel and supplies .  Funds raised for the Regional Response Plan launched on 15 September is expected to not only address some of the urgent needs of the people such a s water and health services which have been severely impaired in many of the islands but challenges such communications and logistics faced by humanitarian actors in delivering assistance  Country Situation Anguilla CDEMA has listed food, water cases, medical supplies , first aid kits, baby kits, generators, tarpaulins, buckets and cleaning supplies as the priority needs of the island. The only hospital in the island, Princess Alexandra Hospital, is operational. There has been significant damage to infrastructure and supplies of essential services such as water and electricity. The Anguilla utility corporations (electricity and water) are working towards the full restoration of their services. The Government aims to have the critical sector services such as tourism, health and education functional over the next six months. Most of the primary and secondary roads have been cleared of debris and other obstructions. All banking institutions will be operational for the first half of the day every week, according to CDEMA. Incoming relief supplies and personnel must be cleared with the Anguilla National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC), to adequately plan for logistics or will be denied entry. The NEOC is the primary response and coordination centre on the island. Antigua and Barbuda Dried and canned food, canned milk for babies and bottled water are priority needs for the people of Barbuda, according to CDEMA. A total of 1,413 persons have been evacuated from Barbuda to Antigua. According to the Antigua and Barbuda Red Cross Society, it will take between six to eight weeks to restore electricity, communications and water to Barbuda. Roads and communications remain affected in Barbuda. Medium to long term needs include building material for houses, financial credit to rest ore economic activity, cleaning equipment, equipment for schools and hospitals, health kits, dignity kits and agricultural goods. The Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, Mr. Gaston Browne, is discouraging returns to Barbuda until essential services are in place. Bahamas Irma did not affect the most populated part of the islands but caused significant impact on islands in the south including Acklins, Crooked Island, Inagua, Mayguana, as well as the Bimini Island on the northwest, according to IOM. The Government is reportedly conducting assessments: the most immediate needs identified are WASH, shelter, protection and health assistance. British Virgin Islands The islands were devastated by Irma. According to the IFRC, the island of Anegada is the worst affected. CDEMA reports baby food, generators, satellite phones, water purification tablets, medical supplies are some of the urgent requirements. There has been significant damage to electricity and water supply across the islands. The main public hospital on the island is partially operational. The shelters are running out of space and several unofficial shelters are now accommodating people. Cuba The Government says preliminary estimates show that 60,500 dwellings have been affected. Efforts are underway to restore power in the 13 -most affected provinces. Strong winds and coastal flooding have damaged several hospitals and clinics in Havana. Regional Situation Report No. 6 | 3  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Coordination Saves Lives | www.unocha.org Communication services have been impaired. National authorities are closely monitoring the relief and recover y operations. Water is being supplied through tankers and food is being sold in the affected areas at subsidised prices. St Maarten Humanitarian actors are continuing with relief efforts. Restoration of water and sanitation services have the highest priority. The general condition of the roads are good for transportation of relief items. St Martin Evacuations are ongoing in one of the more severely impacted islands. Food insecurity, lack of drinking water and damage to telecommunications infrastructure are the main challenges. Turks and Caicos The islands faced the brunt of Irma. According to the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team, the Government has restored the public water system, however it is not functioning to full capacity. There are concerns regarding lack of potable water in the immediate short -term as wat er stations are being repaired. Severely limited communications are hampering the coordination of relief supplies, according to UNDAC. Incomplete information about incoming supplies is preventing the Government from organizing in advance the equitable distribution of relief. Rumours and incomplete information risks undermining planned distributions and are increasing anxiety among people. One of the automatic banking services has been restored to allow some people to replenish diminishing stocks of essential items. The Government continues to take the lead in emergency management. It has issued a customs duty exemption for relief items from 13 September to 31 October. Food supplies are needed for the entire population, according to CDEMA. There is a considerable shortage of potable water. Tarpaulin, generators and shelter facilities are also needed. According to the UK Government, 120 military personnel are on the ground. Thirty troops from the Bermudian regiment will arrive on 16 September. The security situation is calm and a curfew in place will be lifted on 15 September midnight. Funding On 14 September, OCHA launched the RRP to support people most affected by Irma in the Caribbean. The three -month plan required $15.1 million to address the most urgent needs of 265,000 most affected people until December 2017, and $ 11.9 million for complex logistics and communications assistance. Source: RRP Regional Situation Report No. 6 | 4  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Coordination Saves Lives | www.unocha.org The RRP will support the regional effort in the areas of services such as health, food security, protection, water, sanitation and hygiene, education, shelter and coordination . The plan focuses on nations, territories and states of the Caribbean and excludes Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Cuba (for the latter a specific Action Plan is being developed), however it is meant to complement the efforts of humanitarian response mechanisms in these countries. While focusing on urgent priorities to cover emergency needs of the most vulnerable people, the RRP lays the foundation for a strengthened resilience by ﬁbuilding back better.ﬂ It emphasizes the importance of strengthening the humanitarian -development nexus to reduce risk and vulnerability in the face of future climatic shocks. For additional guidance on the RRP, contact Amaia Lopez at OCHA ROLAC ( lopez20@un.org ) Donations via the OCHA website have been activated by the Resource and Communications Section (RMCS) of the CERF at http://www.unocha.org/hurricane -irma The Regional Response Plan can be found at: http://www.unocha.org/sites/unocha/files/Hurricane_Irma_Regional_Response_Plan.pdf All humanitarian partners, including donors and recipient agencies, are encouraged to inform OCHA's Financial Tracking Service (FTS - http://fts.unocha.org) of cash and in -kind contributions by e -mailing: fts@un.org Humanitarian Response CDEMA in collaboration with participating States, regional and international partners, has deployed over 90 response personnel to the affected States and currently has teams in Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Virgin Islands (UK), and Turks Caicos Islands. CDEMA conducted a high level mission comprised of the Secretary General and Chief Executive Officer of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Chair of CARICOM and Prime Minister of Grenada, the Executive Director of CDEMA and the Executive Director of CDEMA Regional Security System (RSS) to Anguilla, Barbuda and the British Virgin Islands from 1 2 to 13 September.  A second high -level mission is planned to Turks and Caicos on 15 September and the Bahamas and Haiti on 16 September. Rapid Needs Assessment Team (RNAT) have carried out assessments in Virgin Gorda, British Virgin Islands, evaluating the status of structures and communications.  Additionally, the National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC) requested RNAT assessments in Tortola.  RNAT engineering personnel has provided support to UK Military units working in the British Virgin Islands. CARICOM Disaster Relief Units (CDRU) in the British Virgin Islands have been working to establish communication systems and receive and distribute emergency relief supplies. The units have already delivered five tonnes of relief supplies and are supporting aerial drops of relief supplies to remote locations. The CARICOM Operational Support Team (COST) continues to provide support to the NEOC in the British Virgin Islands. The NEOC has requested specific support from a telecoms specialist and engineer for restoring telecommunications. The Regional Security System (RSS) continues to facilitate the movement of relief supplies, personnel and equipment between Barbados, Anguilla, Antigua and the British Virgin Islands. The United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), through UK Aid, has provided financial support, relief items and military and humanitarian personnel to the affected islands, as well as support in transport and response to CDEMA. The Government of Canada is providing support to Antigua and Barbuda, British Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands and St Kitts and Nevis with assessment teams, relief supplies, and funding. European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) have delivered high quality maps for the affected European territories in the Caribbean and have deployed humanitarian experts throughout the region to assist local authorities with aid deliveries.  Additionally, ECHO is supporting emergency funding from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). IFRC is deploying support for cash transfer programming to affected islands, as well as assisting in assessments and distribution.  IFRC has been active in supporting the Antigua and Barbuda Red Cross in fundraising and communications support, as well as supporting the St Kitts and Nevis Red Cross in damage assessments.  The British Red Cross is coordinating with Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands, as well as Montserrat, and has provided volunteers and support in distributing relief supplies. Regional Situation Report No. 6 | 5  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Coordination Saves Lives | www.unocha.org CDEMA has committed to follow up on its initial request for disaster waste management expertise - experts could be deployed in the next two to three days. Members of the UNDAC team have noted that disaster waste management is an increasingly pressing issue. Camp Coordination and Camp Management Needs: Needs for Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) (i.e technical support for collective site management) have so far been assessed and identified in Antigua, Barbuda, the British Virgin Islands, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Martin, and Turks and Caicos Islands. Overall, a central management function was absent in many existing collective centres, especially in spontaneous sites self -occupied by affected persons that lost their homes. Additionally, protection concerns, exclusion of certain affected populations, and a lack of community participation have been identified as issues to be addressed. Antigua and Barbuda: IOM reports that the Barrymore Hotel in Antigua, where 47 IDPs are temporarily accommodated with government approval, shows no physical presence or support by authorities or international communities, nor does there appear to be a site manager. Their Immediate needs are food, clothing and NFIs. Two security guards are stationed at the hotel at any given time but without a capacity to provide security for the IDPs. IOM also visited Codrington, Barbuda with Disaster Risk Management authorities, to conduct a needs assessment and identify possible locations to erect shelters. No one remains in Barbuda due to the complete destruction of the islands. Evacuees from Barbuda are temporarily residing in shelters or in some type of hosting arrangement in Antigua. According to IOM, eight locations have been identified with evacuated/displaced populations. Coordination for WASH and food response is not available on the ground. The local government seeks for a longer -term solution such as rental subsidy and transitional shelters. There are significant coordination gaps in Antigua and a lack of participation from the Barbadian evacuees. British Virgin Islands: In British Virgin Islands, 19 government -run emergency shelters are currently in operation and reportedly many unofficial shelters exist, making it difficult to determine the precise number of persons in shelters. While full data is unavailable, about 351 people are estimated to be resided in 10 temporary shelters (Source: WHO/PAHO Situation Report #4, 13 September 2017 & Map Action British Virgin Islands: Hurricane Irma Tortola Shelters Status, 13 September 2017). St Kitts and Nevis: St. Kitts and Nevis is planning to receive evacuees from other islands but it is uncertain about how to manage the influx of population. Saint Martin: In St. Martin, only one shelter, P IMA, is officially open but reportedly a number of unofficial shelters are being used to accommodate displaced populations. A lack of communication with the communities has generated anxieties among the general public. Evacuation of foreign nationals is still ongoing. (Source: WHO/PAHO) Turks and Caicos: CDEMA showed interests in seeing how IOM can support the evacuation of approximately 2,000 people from Caicos to Providenciales. It requires more detailed information and profile of the population to be evacuated. Response Antigua and Barbuda: Two locations were identified In the vicinity of Codrington to establish shelters for displaced populations in Barbuda. IOM is positioned to manage collective sites and temporary shelters in Antigua with one thematic expert. The Antigua and Barbuda Red Cross is registering people in collective sites in Antigua. IOM is liaising with active authorities to provide on the job technical accompaniment for collective site management. Haiti: IOM is arranging for moving contingency stocks that are positioned in Haiti with the help of partners. There are serious technical and logistical difficulties to deploy them in time. Bahamas: In the Bahamas, former residents from Salina Point, Acklins, returned on 12 September to help clean debris from the hurricane. On 13 September, a group returned to Crooked Island and Mayaguana. More movements of return are expected in the following days to Mayaguana and Acklins, and on 15 September, people will return to Acklins and Bimini. Sint Maar ten: The Dutch government has sent about 450 military personnel to St. Maarten to help with security, logistics and recovery. PAHO/WHO are assisting with response coordination. IFRC are providing support with shelter management. Contact person at OIM in Panama: Luz Tantaruna ( ltantaruna@iom.int ) Regional Situation Report No. 6 | 6  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Coordination Saves Lives | www.unocha.org Early Recovery Needs: According to UNITAR/UNOSAT, this is the assessed damage in each Irma -affected English and Dutch Caribbean countries. Damage ranges from less than one per cent of buildings damaged in Antigua to 75 percent of buildings damaged in Barbuda and 92 per cent in St Martin.

Cuba: According to UNDP, the Hurricane affected some 64,000 homes, some partially and totally collapsed and some with partial or total loss of roofs. More than 190,000 people were affected. Prior to Hurricane Irma, the countrys housing exhibited problems, with more than a million homes in a deficient or poor state. Of these homes, 43 per cent are in Havana. The country has recovered 70 per cent of its power service. Hurricane Irma affected 2,300 primary power distribution circuits throughout Cuba, of which 644 are still pending repairs. Response: A UNDP has submitted a recovery response plan as part of the Regional Response Plan. This response plan is focused on short term interventions and immediate actions (for a three -month period) to achieve quick impact and show results on areas such as debris and waste management, housing, restoration of basic services, rehabilitation of community infrastructure as well as support to co re government functions (coordination, assessments and recovery planning). UNDP has elaborated a Regional Recovery Plan to complete the initial response. This includes longer term interventions (for a two -year period) focusing on initiatives to boost resilience, climate change adaptation and linkages with the agenda 2030, aiming to build back better and leave no one behind. Cuba: The Housing and Early Recovery Sector, led by UNDP with the participation of IOM, UN Habitat and UNESCO, continues to prepare information on basic non -food needs for immediate response, including: plastic roofing sheets, mattresses, kitchen kits, sheets, zinc sheets for roofs, and tools. These actions will be coordinated with those of the United Nations agencies that work in the wat er and sanitation, food security and health sectors. UNDP has activated its emergency response mechanism to purchase zinc roofing sheets and Regional Situation Report No. 6 | 7  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Coordination Saves Lives | www.unocha.org corresponding tools and is working with the National Programme for the Local Production of Building Materials to identify main needs in the affected areas. Two UNDP experts are in Cuba to support the UNDP Office to formulate emergency response projects and assist in resource mobilization. They also support procurement processes related to the emergency (tarpaulins, mat tresses and roofs) and diagnose the need for additional support in human resources. St. Martin: UNDP is deploying a recovery advisor. Contact person at UNDP in New York: Ugo Blanco ( ugo.blanco@undp.org )   Education Needs: UNICEF reports that thousands of children are having their education disrupted, as schools across Cuba, Turks and Caicos Islands, British Virgin Islands, Anguilla and Barbuda are damaged. This also raises child protection concerns. The damage to school infrastructure greatly jeopardizes access to education for affected children. UNICEF is using Communication for Development (C4D) strategies and tools to guarantee that all children and adolescents living in the affected areas are protected, healthy and have access to education and participation spaces. Anguilla: All six primary schools in Anguilla have been badly damaged and school may not restart until 1 October. Antigua and Barbuda: The majority of inhabitants of Barbuda, which was almost completely destroyed by Irma, are in Antigua, and despite school restarting on 11 September in Antigua, children from Barbuda were not eligible to attend. UNICEF has identified a need to provide school bags for children from Barbuda in Antigua. UNICEF has also identified that families staying with friends and family in Antigua may not be accessing services. Sint Maarten : UNICEF has reported that the re -establishment of the education system, including early childhood development as the main protective environment, is a priority need. Response: UNICEFs Education section has identified possible candidates to support the Eastern Caribbean Emergency Education and ECD response. The regional office also provided technical support and tools for the preparation of the ECD response plan. Cuba: UNICEF has reviewed the first draft of the CERF for Cuba and updated the references for education supplies. UNICEF plans to work with UNESCO and WHO on Return to Happiness programmes. It is investigating the possibility of expanding its child protection role to include Return to School and Return to Protective Environment programmes as part of Education.  UNICEF is developing a supply plan that includes 100 school in a box kits and 90 recreation kits. Haiti: UNICEF reports schools used a s temporary shelters are currently being cleaned and disinfected to resumed schooling activities. Contingency stocks of schools kits will be distributed shortly to the schools affected by the floods. Contact person at UNICEF in Panama: Douglas Reimer ( dreimer@unicef.org ) Food Security Needs: Food supplies are urgently needed in severely affected islands such as the British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos. Cuba: According to preliminary reports, over 10,000 hectares of food production were damaged mainly in the northern coastal municipalities in central Cuba including major crops such as plantains, tubers, vegetables, grains, fruits, as well as poultry and swine farms. The most critical damage was registered in the Camaguey, Ciego de Avila, Sancti Spiritus and Villa Clara Provinces. Haiti: Preliminary data collected in the northeast Haiti indicates, that Hurricane Irma has critically damaged main livelihoods, such as agriculture and fisheries. Preliminary results from a rapid assessment conducted by 10,000 Hectares of food production damaged in Cuba Regional Situation Report No. 6 | 8  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Coordination Saves Lives | www.unocha.org the Haiti Ministry of Agriculture and FAO estimate that more than 18,000 farmer families are severely affected in the Northeast department. Response: WFP launched an Emergency Operation focused on the Eastern Caribbean valued at US$1.5 million for the provision of 30 mt of high -energy biscuits (HEBs) to support 25,000 people and cash -based transfers (CBT) to support 20,000 people - as required based on consultations with local authorities.

Antigua and Barbuda: IOM staff visited the Barrymore Hotel where 47 IDPs are temporarily accommodated. The hotel was initially closed. IOM also visited Codrington, Barbuda with a Disaster Risk Management authorities, aiming at conducting a needs assessment on the island and identifying possible locations to erect shelters. Two locations have been identified: 1) a school play field with several structures they are still erected but require repairs to roofs, windows and doors; and 2) a sports tarmac field with facing concrete.  UN Women is working in close partnership with the Ministry of Social Transformation to conduct training for shelter manages with IOM, dis tributing additional dignity kits at the shelters in partnership with UNFPA, and conducting focus groups with the displaced Barbudan women and men. Sint Maarten: About 90 per cent of all the houses on St. Maarten suffered some kind of damage. Response: Antigua and Barbuda: Two locations were identified in the vicinity of Codrington to establish shelters for displaced populations in Barbuda. Locations is not ideal as concrete and tarmac floors would not only allow free standing structures. Sint Maarten: In S int Maarten, IOM is liaising with UNDAC and the Netherlands Red Cross on temporary shelter design to define the best layout using materials available and avoid the creation of collective sites unless no alternative exists. Contact person at IFRC Regional Office for the Americas in Panama: Inigo Barrena ( ci.barrena@ifrc.org )   Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Needs: As some people continue to be in shelters a week after the passage of Hurricane Irma, continued access to clean water and good sanitary conditions is critical.

Irma made landfall on northeast Caribbean islands during the early hours of 6 Sept ember, affecting Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, British Virgin Islands, Sint Maarten, St. Martin, the Virgin Islands and other islands in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Since then, thousands of people have been evacuate d from at -risk areas and different level of impact reported from the affected areas. www.unocha.org The mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to mobilize and coordinate effective and principled humanitarian action in partnership with national and international actors. Coordination Saves Lives +For more information, see ﬁbackground on the crisisﬂ at the end of the report The Caribbean: Hurricane Season Situation Report No. 7 (as of 18 September 2017 ) This report is produced by OCHA ROLAC in collaboration with humanitarian partners. It covers the first period from 06 to 1 8 September, 2017. The next report will be issued on or around 20 September 2017. Highlights Humanitarian actors have been forced to shift gears from response to Irma to prepare for potentially catastrophic ﬂ category 5 hurricane, Maria .Heavy rainfall could cause flash floods and mudslides in islands recovering from Irmas onslaught such as Sint Maarten, Barbuda and Anguilla. Evacuation centres are being prepared. More than 2.1 million people in Cuba have been targeted by a US$ 55.8 million Plan of Action to provide assistance to the most affected by Irma. Two high -level events related to Hurricane Irma were held during the UN General Assembly in New York 18 September. $m required for most affected by Irma Source: RRP 265,000 estimated to have been affected by Irma in the Caribbean. Source: RRP $55.8m required to support Cubas post - Irma recovery efforts 2.1m +Cubans targeted by Plan of Action Situation Overview As the humanitarian situation improves in some of the islands recovering from the ferocious impact of Hurricane Irma, aid workers in severely impacted islands such as Sint Maarten have had to shift gears to prepare for category 5 Hurricane Maria. Maria is the sixth hurricane to have formed in the Atlantic Basin this season (from 1 June) which ends in November, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Twenty provinces in the Dominican Republic are under a storm warning. Rainfall on many of the islands on Marias path could cause life -threatening flash floods and mudslides. The UN Disaster Assessment Coordination (UNDAC) is supporting Sint Maarten in its preparedness efforts to face Maria. Evacuation centres and shelters are being prepared for Maria. In the Dominican Republic, the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) has convened in advance of Hurricane Maria and has already placed 20 provinces on alert for hurricane conditions. Authorities are evaluating priority evacuation zones. Maria is also being monitored by Cuba, where more than 2.1 million people - the most vulnerable among those severely affected by Irma in Cuba, will be targeted by a Plan of Action by the UN System to support Cubas recovery efforts. Damage in Havana from Hurricane Irma / PHOTO: Granma Regional Situation Report No. 7 | 2  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Coordination Saves Lives | www.unocha.org Cuba had faced the brunt of Irma where the hurricane made landfall as a category 5 hurricane, with more than 5.6 million people directly affected. The US$55.8 million Plan of Action launched on 18 September will target the most vulnerable - more 2.1 million people - in 33 municipalities seriously impaired by Hurricane Irma to cover their immediate basic needs over the next six months. Restoration of water and power supplies remains a critical requirement in many of the affected islands such as Sint Maarten and Turks and Caicos. The islands of Antigua and Barbuda and Anguilla require generators, water cases, water bowser containers, purifiers and water treatment tablets as the population struggles with shortages of potable water. The situation in the British Virgin Islands has improved with the restoration of power and opening of local markets. Ferries are operational again and the airport was expected to be opened for commercial flights on 18 September. More than 90 per cent of buildings on Sint Maarten and 7 5 per cent of standing structures in Barbuda were destroyed by Irma, according to a preliminary building damage assessment overview map by the Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT) of the UN Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR). UNOSAT will release its comprehensive building damage assessment across the Caribbean in the wake of Irma this week. In an effort to allow for a better flow of the relief supply pipeline, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) has urge d donating organisations and individuals to organize relief supplies in categories. It has also urged donors to consult with the list of needs identified by the islands on CDEMAs website. A high -level event on Hurricane Irma was held at the UN General Assembly in New York, where the UN Secretary -General António Guterres urged efforts to boost resilience and strengthen damage mitigation measures. UN agencies have been assisting with response and recovery efforts since the storm struck and last week, the Organization launched a $15.1 million regional humanitarian response plan, covering the urgent needs of the most vulnerable populations impacted. The plan aims to reach an estimated 265,000 affected people until the end of this year. In another high -level eve nt in New York on 18 September, the Under -Secretary -General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, allocated US$10 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to enable humanitarians to help tens of thousands o f people in need of assistance following the devastating category 5 storm, Hurricane Irma. Funding On 18 September , the Under -Secretary -General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, allocated US$10 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to enable humanitarians to help tens of thousands of people in need of assistance following the devastating category 5 storm, Hurricane Irma. The funds will enable the United Nations and other organizations to support the national and regional response immediately to provide food, critical health care, clean water and other urgently needed ai d to the people most affected by Irma, in particular women and girls. On the same day, a Plan for Action $55.8 million for the people of Cuba was launched to support the immediate needs of more than 2.1 million. The affected peoples most urgent needs are in five priority sectors: shelter and early recovery; food security, water, sanitation and hygiene; health; and education. The largest number of people require support with health services (2,151,080) as around 70 per cent of hospital and polyclinics in the affected areas have been damaged. Regional Situation Report No. 7 | 3  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Coordination Saves Lives | www.unocha.org Cuba Plan of Action 2017: Requirements by Sector More than 2 million peoples access to water has been most impacted. These people live in the seven out of the 13 Cuban provinces most affected by Irma. At least 664,000 of the most vulnerable people (children under 5, pregnant and lactating women and elderly people) need urgent food assistance. More than 75,000 hectares of agricultural land, pig farming, poultry and aquaculture facilities have been destroyed. The Plan of Action is asking for $14.7 million to address food needs and restore agricultural and fishery production and livelihoods of 930,000 people. On 14 September, OCHA launched the Regional Response Plan to support people most affected by Irma in the Caribbean. The three -month plan required $15.1 million to address the most urgent needs of 265,000 most affected people until December 2017, and $11.9 million f or complex logistics and communications assistance.

In particular, PAHO notes the logistical difficulties in moving their supplies out of Barbados to affected islands, specifically the British Virgin Islands, and are exploring options for transporting cargo. PAHO has reported that maintaining sanitary conditions, especially in shelters, continues to be a priority. Security issues are complicating humanitarian response including logistical issues for the islands to receive and distribute basic supplies Heightened epidemiological surveillance to support early detection and timely management of disease outbreaks will be important in the coming days due to lack of access to clean water, healthcare and treatment, and increase in vectors and rodents. Some shelters are already reporting diarrheal and skin diseases. Vector -borne -diseases should be prevented by quickly cleaning debris that may create breeding sites when it rains. Environmental Health should also be addressed in these islands as clearing and recovery continues. UNICEF estimates that 15,000 children and adolescents in the affected islands of the Eastern Caribbean are in need of psycho -social support and protective environment. Cuba: Seventy -three per cent of hospitals and polyclinics in 27 municipalities have been damaged The most damages reported are from Policlinico Marcio Manduley, Hospital América Arias and Hospital Hermanos Ameijeiras Surgical Hospital. Two hospitals were completely evacuated in Havana, which may have an impact on medical supplies of hospitals that accepted overflow of these patients. Major hospitals in Havana are expected to be up and running by next week. Immediate needs for essential medicines, sanitation, and vector control has been identified. Response: The Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) is providing technical assistance in assessing vector control in Antigua and Barbuda, as wel l as working with CDEMA and PAHO to coordinate vector control response throughout the affected islands. PAHO remains active in assisting authorities throughout the Eastern Caribbean (Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, Saint Mar tin and Sint Maarten) with coordinating emergency projects to cover medical supplies, reestablish health services, and purchase of essential medicines and medical equipment. Antigua and Barbuda: PAHO has identified five health centers to serve the population that was evacuated from Barbuda. Cuba: PAHO has deployed a specialist to assist authorities with assessments and vector control, as well as the health of displaced people. PAHO is looking to ship six emergency health kits to assist 10,000 people each - for a total of 60,000 people - for the next three months.

Irma made landfall on no \rtheast Caribbean islands during the early hours of 6 September, affecting Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, British Virgin Islands, Sint Maarten, St. Martin, the Virgin Islands and other islands in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Since then, thousands of people have been evacuate d from at -risk areas and different level of impact reported from the affected areas. Hurricane Maria is fast approaching several of the already affected islands with the potential to cause even more damage. www.unocha.org The mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to mobilize and coordinate effective and principled humanitarian action in partnership with national and international actors. Coordination Saves Lives + For more information, see ﬁbackground on the crisisﬂ at the end of the report The Caribbean: Hurricane Season Situation Report No. 08 (as of 20 September 2017 )   This report is produced by OCHA ROLAC in collaboration with humanitarian partners. It covers the first period from 06 to 20 September, 2017. The next report will be issued on or around 25 September 2017. Highlights Hurricane Maria pummeled Dominica on 19 September, with early reports citing widespread damage and destruction. Reconnaissance teams have conducted flyovers and more assessment teams are expected to arrive on 21 September. Many organizations have suspended Hurricane Irma response activities across islands in or around Marias path. With Maria on the horizon, evacuations are underway in the Dominican Republic. 260km/h Maximum sustained wind speeds of Hurricane Maria as it passed over Dominica 7 people Confirmed to have been killed by Hurricane Maria in Dominica 90%-95% of roofs in Dominica that were damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Maria, according to estimates from aerial reconnaissance missions. Situation Overview As Maria, a category 3 hurricane on 18 September transformed into a category 5 storm within a matter of hours, most of the islands on its path in the Caribbean braced for the brutal onslaught. As the warning was sounded, the humanitarian community had to put their relief efforts in response to Irma on hold in territories such as the British Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos and countries like Antigua and Barbuda expected to be in Marias path to support evacuation efforts and other contingency measures. Dominica, one of the poorest countries in the Caribbean, faced the full -force of the hurricane which claimed the lives of seven people on the island. The hurricane tore through the entire island, ripping rooftops, power lines and water pipelines directly or indirectly affecting the entire 70,000 odd population of the country, according to reports received by the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA). Based on financial estimates of the impact of previous tropical storms such a s Erika which made landfall on Dominica in 2015, Ronald Jackson, Executive Director of CDEMA said damage to the country could run into billions of dollars. The agency has suggested that the entire population might have to be evacuated. Of particular concern, are communities in remote parts of the island, such as the indigenous Kalinago, who live in the eastern part of the island. However, the island has been cut -off from the rest of the world.

One of the major hospitals in the country has been damaged compromising patients and CDEMA said it was trying to coordinate urgent repair s. One of the two major airports in the island, near the capital, Roseau is flooded, while the road network to the other has been damaged. CDEMA and the humanitarian community have been forced to send relief supplies and aid personnel by sea. According to aid sources, the port in Roseau has been cleared to receive relief supplies. A UN Disaster Assessment Coordination (UNDAC) team member is on his way to Dominica and is expected to arrive on 21 September. Neighbouring countries such as Saint Lucia have sent relief supplies expected to get to the island by 21 September. Most of Dominicas people live along the coastlines, making them extremely vulnerable to storm surges, flooding and wind damage. Some people also live in homes constructed on hill slopes in in the interior exposing them to the threat of landslides. Guadeloupe, which faced some of Marias impact, with several of its road networks affected by fallen trees is making efforts to limp back to normalcy. Many thousands of people remain without power. As Maria makes its way through the Caribbean, the aid community in Dominican Republic and Turks and Caicos have already taken preemptive measures. National authorities in the Dominican Republic have been carrying out evacuations in the 13 provinces expect ed to be affected by Hurricane Maria. The Dominican Republic National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC), has placed eight provinces on red alert and another five provinces on yellow alert ahead of Hurricane Marias forecasted arrival as a major storm late on 20 September or early 21 September.  The NEOC has suspended school activities in provinces under red alert and is coordinating with provincial authorities to provide adequate food supplies to shelters. In Haiti, civil protection and disaster management authorities have placed the northern region on alert.  Although Maria is not expected to pass directly over Haiti, there are concerns over the threat of flooding, landslides and storm surges in areas that were affected by Irma. The Department of Civil Protection (DPC) and the Secretariat for Risk and Disaster Management (SPGRD) are asking people in the northern regions to stay tuned to weather reports and follow security instructions if needed. CDEMA has asked personnel in the Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos responding to Irmas impact to remain and has deployed personnel from Jamaica and Belize. The first wave of response will be coordinated by CDEMA. Funding Several initiatives to fund humanitarian operations in the Caribbean have been launched recently. This week an allocation of US$10 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) was made to enable humanitarians to help tens of thousands of people in need of assistance following the devastating category 5 storm, Hurricane Irma. The funds will help the United Nations and other organizations to support the national and regional response immediately to provide food, critical health care, clean water and other urgently needed aid to the people most affected by Irma, in particular women and girls. A Plan for Action $55.8 million for the people of Cuba was launched this week as well to support the immediate needs of more than 2.1 million. The affected peoples most urgent needs are in five priority sectors: shelter and early recovery; food security, water, sanitation and hygiene; health; and education. The largest number of people require support with health services (2,151,080) as around 70 per cent of hospital and polyclinics in the affected areas have been damaged. On 14 September, OCHA launched the Regional Response Plan to support people most affected by Irma in the Caribbean. The three -month plan required $15.1 million to address the most urgent needs of 265,000 most affected people until December 2017, and $11.9 million for complex logistics and communications assistance.

It has sent a shipment of 250 family packages comprising water and non -perishable food items with the support of the Barbados Coast Guard to Dominica on 20 September. Given the limited access to Dominica, it is still too early to provide any significant additional information on Dominica until the CDEMA / OCHA assessment scheduled for 21 September takes place. Many organizations are planning to deploy personnel to Dominica as soon as access is restored. In many instances, humanitarian response activities have had to be put on hold or suspended as Hurricane Maria passes through the Caribbean. In the Dominican Republic, coordination is taking place between the UN Emergency Technical Team (UNETE), Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) and the NEOC ahead of Hurricane Marias arrival. The Multi Cluster/ Sector Initial Rapid Assessment (MIRA) survey questionnaire s are already being adapted for eventual field missions after the passage of Hurricane Maria. MIRA is a joint assessment tool which provides a process for collecting and analyzing information, particularly useful during a sudden onset emergency. Country Emergency Situation Report No. 8 | 4  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Coordination Saves Lives | www.unocha.org Cam p Coordination and Camp Management Needs: Sint Maarten: Post Hurricane -Maria, main needs identified have been assistance for self -repair and individual shelter. For CCCM, there is a need to consolidate evacuation centers into a smaller number and the referral of protection cases. Response: Antigua and Barbuda: As Hurricane Maria posed an imminent threat to the islands, most response activities were put on hold. Site visits will resume later this week along with government partners. The Department of Environment (DoE) is planning to implement clean -up activities across the island of Barbuda. IOM will support these activities as required through the provision of technical expertise. Sint Maarten: IOM staff provided bi -hourly updates on developments in evacuation centres as Hurricane Maria passed. Fifteen centres are available, each with a capacity for 2,440 people. A CCCM expert is in St. Maarten and provided coordination and updates on developments to partners on the ground during the passage of Hurricane Mari a.  As the storm effects diminish in Sint Maarten, people are returning home. Pre -positioned tarpaulins are being handed out to returning families along with food rations and bottled water as most have got damaged roofs in their homes. A response plan is being discussed with the Dutch and local authorities.  This plan is projected to be a phased approach with one -month, three -month, and one year phases and outcomes. Dominican Republic: Coordination is underway for the management of the collective centres. Centres will be managed by Red Cross personnel and civil defense with technical guidance from IOM. Mandatory preventive evacuation began on 20 September. Barbados: IOM will deploy staff to assist on displacement reporting, to arrive on 21 September. Contact person at OIM in Panama: Luz Tantaruna ( ltantaruna@iom.int )   Early Recovery Needs: Antigua and Barbuda: Health and security are main issues in Barbuda, as are debris and waste management and assistance to displaced families. Shelter, sanitation, health and basic services are needed for workers to stay in the island until some buildings can be repaired. Response: UNDP has eight crisis response experts deployed in Antigua, Sint Maarten, Turks and Caicos and soon in the British Virgin Island, at the request of their respective Governments. Several others are on standby for deployment. UN Women is coordinating with UNDP in Barbados and Antigua to develop a skills training programme that will supplement cash for work initiatives undertaken under the regional response. Cuba: Three UNDP experts are in Cuba. Antigua and Barbuda: A debris and waste management mission was conducted on 20 September by national authorities and experts from PAHO and UNDP. The team confirmed that all Government buildings have been destroyed or severely damaged. An action plan for debris and waste management is being prepared by national authorities with technical support from UNDP. Debris and waste management operations is now planned to start on 21 September, after the delay caused by Hurricane Maria. Cash -for -work schemes together with tools and heavy machinery will be used. Efforts to initiate repairs to houses will be planned soon as part of the recovery plan that may include other areas such as social and economic recovery, disaster risk reduction and restoration of core government functions. PAHO and UNDP are working together to provide technical assistance to national authorities.

This also raises child protection concerns. The damage to school infrastructure greatly jeopardizes access to education for affected children. Response: UNICEF has five staff members deployed to Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Turks and Caicos and the British Virgin Islands to undertake assessments particularly focusing on child protection and education sector management, water and sanitation, shelter management, communication for development needs and planning for psychosocial support of children start -up. UNICEF is planning a long -term deployment to the British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos after Hurricane Maria passes over to address education issues. Antigua and Barbuda: UNICEF is providing support in identifying gaps in analyzing education needs and is working to integrate children evacuated from Barbuda into Antiguas education system. Cuba: UNICEF has reviewed the first draft of the CERF for Cuba and updated the references for education supplies. UNICEF plans to work with UNE SCO and WHO on Return to Happiness programmes. UNICEF is targeting 226,000 children for assistance in its response plan by providing materials, education kits, early care kits and recreation kits, as well as roofing and WASH support for schools. UNICEFs response will also provide psychosocial support. The Plan of Action seeks to address the immediate establishment of temporary safe and protective learning spaces and provision of essential instructional and recreational materials that enable the safe return to school. Priorities include the reconstruction of roofs, windows and water and sanitation supplies in educational spaces in affected municipalities, as well as the socio -emotional support to enable emotional recovery. Contact person at UNICEF in Panama: Douglas Reimer ( dreimer@unicef.org )  Food Security Needs: WFP food assistance is complementing the immediate response provided by governments, United Nations agencies and non -governmental organizations with the objective to save hurricane -affected vulnerable peoples lives and protect their livelihoods in the emergency. Food assistance is already being provided to the most vulnerable groups as per discussions with partners and local authorities in the Eastern Caribbean, Haiti and Cuba. FAO is in contact with the Ministries of Agriculture of affected countries in order to determine needs for the rehabilitation of the agricultural livelihoods, as well as for the ecosystem and environmental services. Antigua and Barbuda: A FAO expert will support the PDNA in Barbuda, either physically or through remote assistance to the process and the government. Cuba: WFPs Executive Director, David Beasley visited Cuba on 15 -16 September, where he met with the Government of Cuba to express WFPs support. WFP in coordination with the government will launch a US$ 5.7 million emergency operation to provide food assistance to more than 660,000 people. To complement the governments response, the first phase of WFPs emergency operation will begin immediately with the distribution of a monthly ration of rice, beans and oil to 664,000 people living in the hardest-hit areas. A FAO expert has been deployed to assist with resource mobilization as part of the Food Security and Nutrition component of the Cuba Action Plan, and as part of a comprehensive FAO response aimed at restoring agricultural production. Dominica: WFP has deployed two additional food security staff.  A FAO expert will participate in a Damage Assessment Needs Analysis (DANA ) led by CDEMA. Haiti: Several needs assessment s were conducted and consolidated - results are expected shortly.  Based on the results, WFP may set up recovery activities in the most affected areas in the coming weeks. Potential partnerships with other UN agencies will also be explored to maximize the impact of such interventions. Sint Maarten: WFP operations have been suspended until Hurricane Maria passes.

Strengthening capacity in addressing mental health in impacted population, especially those in shelters is important. Repairing damaged health facilities in impacted islands is crucial in managing emergency patients, quick diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and reestablish treatment of non -communicable diseases. Antigua and Barbuda: With massive destruction and stagnant water, health in Barbuda is a crucial issue due to a massive infestation of mosquitos that carry diseases such as Zika, dengue and Chikungunya. Large number of dead animals increases the proliferation of insects. Vector control activities initiated on 16 September. PAHO is providing support. Water sources may be contaminated by waste. Situation may worsen with Hurricane Maria. British Virgin Islands : Hurricane Maria barely pas sed over, but the rainfall was enough to have to affect the geriatric homes that had been damaged by Irma. Dominica: PAHO reports that there are concerns about the state of one of the hospitals, as it has suffered heavy damage and the dialysis machine has been destroyed.  Power is down throughout the island, affecting the hospitals operational capacity. Guadeloupe: Hurricane Maria left one of the hospitals in Guadeloupe considerably damaged, according to PAHO. There have been discussions to move critical patients to other islands. St Kitts and Nevis : After some rainfall from Hurricane Maria, PAHO reports that hospitals are considered to be structurally sound.  There are reports of flooding in some health centers, as well as damages to roofs. Response: As needed medical and humanitarian supplies are identified by countries and shared with PAHO, medical and other supplies have been prepositioned in Panama and Barbados for rapid distribution in preparation for Hurricane Maria. As new information emerges from the field, new possible deployments may be considered by health authorities, especially after the passage of Hurricane Maria. A second round of deployments is being organized. Antigua and Barbuda: PAHO is deploying an epidemiologist as well a WASH specialist. Contact person at PAHO/WHO in Washington: Ciro Ugarte ( ugarteci@paho.org ) and contact email for PAHO EOC: eoc@paho.org and EMT: emt@paho.org Protection Needs: UN Wo men is waiting for more information on damage caused by Maria to organize for additional response.

UNICEF is also part of this joint initiative. o Shelter guidelines are being developed with the Directorate for Gender Affairs with support from UN Women in partnership with IOM. o A referral pathway is being put in place with the Directorate for Gender Affairs, supported by UN Women in partnership with UNFPA. o A coordination meeting for psychosocial support was established under the coordination of IFRC and in partnership with UN Women, UNFPA and UNICEF. (It will meet every Wednesday afternoon). Country Emergency Situation Report No. 8 | 7  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Coordination Saves Lives | www.unocha.org o Two separate trainings will take place the week of 25 September - 1) training for shelter management 2) security and GBV prevention in shelters. The training will be conducted by a partnership from IOM, UN Women, UNFPA. o UN Women will organize in partnership with UNFPA focus group with displaced Barbudan women and men. Sint Maarten: UN Women is exploring surge capacity options, including the possibility of a humanitarian specialist. Contact person at UN Women in Panama: Alma Perez ( alma.perez@unwomen.org ) and at UNFPA in Panama: Jayne Adams ( adams@unfpa.org )  Shelter Needs: UNICEF reports that there is presently no detailed time -frame for the return of the people evacuated from the isl and of Barbuda to Antigua. Most of the people are staying with family or friends, while an estimated 300 people are staying in shelters. Antigua and Barbuda: IOM staff visited some temporary shelters and conducted a needs assessment in Barbuda to identify possible locations to erect shelters.  UN Women is working in close partnership with the Ministry of Social Transformation to conduct training for shelter managers with IOM, distribute additional dignity kits at the shelters in partnership with UNFPA, and organize focus groups with the displaced Barbudan women and men. Sint Maarten: About 90 per cent of all the houses on St. Maarten suffered some kind of damage. Cuba: Initial assessments suggest that up to 90 per cent of houses are destroyed in the worst affected areas. Businesses, schools, public buildings and essential services have been destroyed as well. In view of the large scale of destruction in some affected areas, the rehabilitation of damaged houses and emergency shelter structures is a priority, as is the distribution of essential Non -food items. Response: An IOM expert on shelter solutions is in transit to Barbados for deployment in Caribbean islands later in the week of 18 to 22 September. Contact person at IFRC Regional Office for the Americas in Panama: Inigo Barrena ( ci.barrena@ifrc.org )   Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Needs: XUNICEF estimates that in the affected islands in the Eastern Caribbean, 19,200 children, of which 5,500 aged under five, are deprived of access to safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene and safety. Anguilla:  UNICEF has identified the following supply needs in Anguilla: 10,000 water cases, 200 tarpaulins, 200 water containers, 500 cleaning kits, 10,000 units of mosquito repellent, 5,000 hygiene kits, Cuba: UNICEF has identified WASH as a priority area - water supplies are gradually beginning to be restored throughout the country. Response: UNICEF is exploring sending a WASH specialist already deployed in Antigua to Dominica. Cuba: UNICEF will be providing chlorine tablets, jerry cans, hygiene kits and hygiene messaging. Supplies of 55,440 water purification tablets have arrived. UNICEF will also support water distribution and disinfection efforts. PAHO will support WA SH efforts by monitoring the water quality. The Plan of Action will address the prevention of morbidity and mortality caused by unsafe drinking water and sanitation deficiencies, diarrheal diseases, water and vector borne diseases in addition to strengthening and adjusting the existing hygiene promotion programs in the context of the emergency Contact person at UNICEF in Panama: Douglas Reimer ( dreimer@unicef.org ) Country Emergency Situation Report No. 8 | 8  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Coordination Saves Lives | www.unocha.org Emergency Telecommunications Needs :  After two category -5 hurricanes made landfall in the Caribbean, the fundamental Information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure in many islands have been severely damaged. The exact extent of telecommunications needs is yet to be determined. Severely limi ted communications are hampering the coordination of relief supplies in Turks and Caicos Islands. Response: In Sint Maarten, an Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) assessment is ongoing with local authorities and Dutch military to identify the best location for installing communications equipment. WFP, the global lead of the ETC, deployed its regional IT Officer to act as Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Coordinator. ETC members, Ericsson Response, the Government of Luxembourg and WFP have two teams one based in Antigua for humanitarian coordination and onwards deployment to areas identified in need in coordination with the governments, and the second team deployed to Saint Martin for setting up internet connectivity at the humanitarian hub. The ETC team is planning an assessment mission to Dominica which was pummeled by Hurricane Maria. Additional deployments are on hold, as Hurricane Maria is still making its way through the Caribbean affecting the same islands hit by Irma less than two weeks ago. Once the situation stabilises, a request for telecommunications support is expected in British Virgin Islands, Guadeloupe, and others. Logistics Needs :  WFP urgently needs financial support for its operations and is using internal advance financing mechanisms to be able to implement its efforts, which will need to be repaid. CDEMA and the Governments have requested WFP to provide mobile storage units to support the ongoing emergency response. Response: WFP is transporting and providing critical non -food items, including mobile storage units, tarpaulins, prefabs, generators and other logistics support equipment to the region in response to Irma. WFP has already carried out two cargo charters to both hubs to enable the establishment of the support to all actors. WFPs United Nations Humanitarian Air Service(UNHAS) has started operating from Santo Domingo with a Helicopter and from Antigua with a Cessna Caravan plane. WFP is also considering the service provision of sea transport among the islands. WFP is exploring ways to access Dominica for assessments from all Eastern Caribbean islands.

UNICEF Regional Humanitarian Situation Report No. 2 HIGHLIGHTS Islands that suffered extensive damage to infrastructure continue to have challenges restoring access to electricity and clean water As some people continue to be in shelters one week after the passage of Hurricane Irma , continued access to clean water and good sanitary conditions is critical In Cuba, 13 of the 15 provinces were affected by the hurricane with 14 municipalities have been identified as heavily affected and 6 municipalities as in critical condition. Two hospitals in Havana were evacuated. The Sint Maarten Medical Center (SMMC) hospital is functioning again, although there are issues with access to water The United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reported 17 deaths due to Hurricane Irma, and over 22,000 people are occupying 195 shelters throughout seven affected states. Islands with heavy devastation need additional staff support to replace healthcare workers who have been working round - the - clock since the passage of Hurricane Irma, many of whom were also impacted by the storm Heightened epidemiological surveillance to support early detection and timely management of disease outbreaks will be important in the coming days due to lack of access to clean water, healthcare and treatment, and increase in vectors and rodents Source: Pan American Health Organization Health Emergencies The assessment of Hanna Thomas Hospital and Hanna Thomas Health Center in Barbuda indicated that the health center is severely damaged and inoperable after the passage of Hurricane Irma. 2 SITUATION OVERVIEW Hurricane Irma, a category 5 hurricane traversed the Atlantic bringing maximum sustained winds of 296 km/h and heavy rains. The most heavily impacted islands are Anguilla, Barbuda, British Virgin Islands, Cuba, Saint Martin, Sint Maarten, and Turks and Cai cos. Islands that suffered extensive damage to infrastructure continue to have challenges restoring access to electricity and clean water . Repairing damaged health facilities in impacted islands is crucial in managing emergency patients, quick diagnosis an d treatment of diseases, and reestablish treatment of non - communicable diseases. ANGUILLA The Valley National Emergency Operations Center Warehouse is the designated point for persons to receive aid. A Sector Needs Assessment is being conducted to prioritize restoration efforts. There continues to be shortage of fuels for generators, and there is need for coordination for logistics in terms of food and supplies. Status of health centers indicate that East End and Valley Health Center sustained damage s. Welches Polyclinic is without damages to the structure. Response: A medical team from the Cayman Islands will be assisting and providing medical supplies. The Clayton J Lloyd International Airport is currently operational for Charters and emergencies AN TIGUA AND BARBUDA The parliament of Antigua and Barbuda is maintaining the evacuation order for Barbuda , and extensive assessment of Barbuda is ongoing to determine what can be salvaged and cleaned. There remain 274 persons in two main shelters. Health promotion materials, WASH materials, and basic drugs were identified as needed. Routine healthcare services continue in Antigua at the public hospital and 25 health centers. Five health centers have been identified to serve the population that was evacuated from Barbuda. A standardized shelter surveillance system is necessary to establish a strong epidemiological surveillance. Response: International Organization for Migration (IOM) is in position to manage shelters. PAHO experts in health disaster coordination and epidemiology arrived to Antigua, and a WASH expert will be to Antigua and Barbuda. BAHAMAS Airports are opened and flight services have resumed. The team that assessed Ragged Island and Acklins Island indicated the clinics sustained damage , although the one in Acklins is in a good state. Ragged Island is currently considered unlivable , and the remaining people have been asked to evacuate. Grand Bahamas has limited property damage and power, electricity and water services are expected to be restored. Response: The damage assessments on healthcare centers indicated that the Ragged Island Clinic can be restored after repair. Acklins clinic sustained minor damage and can function. PAHO Country Office worked with the Haitian Embassy and Haitian N GO, HOPHAS, when hurricane alert was given to advise the general communication and informing migrants about shelters available at churches. BRITISH VIRGIN ISLAN DS Preliminary assessment indicates that British Virgin Island is one of the most affected islands by Hurricane Irma. Electricity has been restored to parts of Road Town or available through generators. Piped water facility is not functional due to lack of electricity, and limited stock of potable water is available. Some cisterns are reportedly contaminated. The main roads have been cleared, but some roads are still inaccessible. Transportation is limited because majority of the vehicles were damaged during the storm . Partial telephone coverage was recovered, and cell sites have been set up. Approximately 351 persons are housed in 10 temporary shelters. The major Peebles Hospital is operational and providing regular services after having Clinic in the Valley suffered minor damage. The North Sound Clinic roof is being restored with tarps over the roof and plywood over the windows and doors. The Adina Donovan Home lost part of its roof and residents have been relocated to the ground floor. Limited medical supplies are available. There are 14 official shelters in operation, but many unofficial shelters exist, making it difficult to determine how many persons are in shelters. Response: British naval ship supplied medical supplies and water. PAHO is working to procure medical and humanitarian supplies and coordinating logistics for immediate delivery. PAHO technical staff participated in needs and damage assessments, and LSS/SUMA was set up at the airport to receive small shipments. There are space constraint s , and coordination will be critical in receiving larger shipments. CUBA Thirteen of the 15 provinces were affected by the hurricane with 14 municipalities have been identified as heavily affected and 6 municipalities in critical condition . A total of 32 health facilities reported damages to infrastructure including roof, walls, ceilings, windows and flooding. T he most damages reported from Policlinico Marcio Manduley, Hospital América Arias and Hospital Hermanos Ameijeiras Surgical Hospital . Two hospitals were completely evacuated in Havana , which may have an impact on medical supplies of hospitals that accepted overflow of these patients. Major hospitals in Havana are expected to be up and running by next week. Immediate needs for essential medicines, sanitation, and vector control has been identified. Response: Health authorities are working to restore water supply as well as sanitation systems to avoid disease outbreaks. Restoring power to health centers has been prioritized . Th e health sector is assessing water quality. Three emergency kits are being purchased to support health facilities. PUERTO RICO The number of hospitals on generator power reduced to 6, and one hospital remain closed. There are still 43,000 people without 3 water and 304,000 people without electricity. SAINT MARTIN AND SAINT BARTHELEMY Saint Martin evacuations are ongoing. There is still no access to drinking water after the desalination plant was heavily dam aged by the hurricane. The hospital which is providing emergency and pathology services in Saint Martin is supported by medical staff from Guadeloupe and France . Critical patients are being medically evacuated, and two triage tents have been set up at the airport. Comprehensive engineering assessment of the Saint Martin hospital found it to be structurally sound. Communication remains an issue with the hospital, and a radio antenna is planned to be established to facilitate communication. In Saint Barthelemy, the hospital is partially operational and offering some medical services. The laboratory is also operational. The desalination plant is not operational and only bottled water is available. Water quality at the hospitals has been tested and are awaiting results. Aqua tabs for both islands have been identified as needed. Response: There are 1,500 state agents are on the ground to protect the population and distribute water and food. Epidemiologists were deployed to Saint Martin and Saint Barthelemy to support surveillance. Mental Health support (CUMP) was mobilized from Martinique to Saint Martin to provide support to persons waiting at the airport for evacuation. SINT MAARTEN The hospital is functioning again, although there are issues with access to water. Restoration of water and sanitation services have the highest priority . Information on assessment of Sint Maarten Medical Center (SSMC) indicates that pharmacy, laboratory, gynecology and policlinic services were damaged. CT scan machine has water damage, and bed capacity has been reduced to 40% at the hospital and 50% at the policlinics. Surveillance for infectious diseases is ongoing, especially with reported acute diarrheal cases. Medication inventory is currently acceptable, and vaccine cold chain has been maintained through the impact of the hurricane. Five mental health patients have been seen , and mental health services will continue. The S int Maarten Laboratory Service (SLS) is not operational due to roof damage and l ack of access to water. Repairs are ongoing. Water safety measures, sanitation supplies, medical supplies and generators have been identified as needed. Support in water sanitation and quality control as well as disease surveillance is needed. Response: The Dutch military presence is strong on the island. PAHO is supporting in damage assessments and response coordination including liaison between the hospital and military . A surveillance system was established by the national epidemiologist. TURKS AND CAICOS Due to severe damage t o infrastructure, some islands remain without utilities and communication. Severe damage to major government buildings, hospital, schools, churches and community centers were reported. Lack of shelter facilities and sanitation continue to be major concerns. The hospital in Grand Turk suffered roof damage and only primary services are being offered. There is currently no electricity or water on the island. Patients in need of dialysis and serious treatment are being sent via helicopter to the hospital in Providenciales which is damaged but continues to function. Airport in Providenciales is planned to be open today. Shelters in Providenciales are housing 150 people. South Caicos has no electricity, no running water, and lack of communications which is hampering with damage and needs assessments. UNITED STATES The United States Federal Emergency Management Agency reported 17 deaths due to Hurricane Irma . Eleven hospitals remain closed, and 204 healthcare facilities have been evacuated in Florida. Over 2 2,000 people are occupying 195 shelters throughout seven affected states. UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS Lack of access to water continues to be an issue, and boil water advisories are in place for Saint Thomas and Saint John. Drinking water stations have be en set up throughout the islands. 30,000 people continue to be without electricity. There are currently 181 people in 5 shelters. NEEDS As the healthcare workers have been working round the clock since the passage of Hurricane Irma, many of whom were also impacted by the storm, there is need for a surge in human resource capacity to replace the tired staff. Repairing damaged health facilities in impacted islands is crucial in managing emergency patients, quick diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and reestablish treatment of non - communicable diseases. Heightened epidemiological surveillance to support early detection and timely management of disease outbreaks will be important in the coming days due to lack of access to clean water, healthcare and treatment, and increase in vectors and rodents . Vector - borne - diseases should be prevented by quickly cleaning debris that may create breeding sit es when it rains. Environmental Health should also be addressed in these islands as clearing and recovery continues. Strengthening capacity in addressing mental health in impacted population, especially those in shelters is important. 4 Security issues are complicating humanitarian response including logis ics for the islands to receive and distribute basic supplies. As urgent humanitarian needs are identified, efficient coordination of humanitarian assistance and information management is necessary to effectively address them. As electrical outage is reported in many of these islands, restoring access to drinking water remains a challenge. There is an estimated 12,000 people on the move from one island to another after the devastation of the hurricane. This could indicate that logistics need to be improved to establish warehouse and distribution chain in order to deliver needed medical supplies, water and food. RESPONSE ACTIONS The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is coordinating emergency projects to cover medical supplies, reestablish health services, and purchase of essential medicines and medical equipment. The United Nations (UN) is developing a joint UN Response Strategy that lays out the priorities of international humanitarian agencies (UN and NGOs and IFRC), working closely with national Governments and regional counterparts in particular CDEMA. Deployments of human resources as part of a surge capacity to support the Ministry of Health and humanitarian response as the authorities identify needs. This includes staff deployed by PAHO, Emergency Medical Team (EMT), and the Regional Rapid Response Team (RRT) . Focus areas in deployments include coordination, damage assessment, epidemiological surveillance, logistics, information management, and water and sanitation. Rapid Response Team experts including logisticians, electrical engineers, assessment and WASH experts have been deployed . Requested supplies are being provided by PAHO and country offices in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. As needed medical and other supplies are identified by countries and shared with PAHO , medical and other supplies are being prepositioned in Panama and Barbados for rapid distribution. Through the Regional CICOM, coordination is ongoing to support deployment to the most affected areas of the Caribbean. PAHO continues to assessing the needs in other islands affected by Hurricane Irma. As new information emerges from the field, new possible deployments may be considered by Health Authorities.

UNISTAR UNOSTAT population exposure map (7 September 2017) 2. UNICEF Regional Humanitarian Situation Report No. 2 HIGHLIGHTS Islands that suffered extensive damage to infrastructure continue to have challenges restoring electricity and clean water which is further complicated by logistical challenges. As some people continue to be in shelters more than a week after the passage of Hurricane Irma , there is need to continue access to clean water and improve sanitary conditions at the shelters. In Cuba , t wo hospitals in Havana were evacuated and latest reports indicate that 516 hospitals and policlinics have been damaged . Repairing damaged health facilities in impacted islands is crucial in managing emergency patients, quick diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and reestablish treatment of non - communicable diseases. In Antigua and Barbuda, a daily syndromic surveillance reporting system is to be implemented at the hospital, five main health centers , and the government shelters . The Sint Maarten Medical Center (SMMC) hospital is partially functioning , although access to water remains a problem. There is need for a surge in human resource capacity to replace the healthcare staffs that have been working round the clock since day one.

BRITISH VIRGIN ISLAN DS Assessments indicate that British Virgin Island is one of the most affected islands by Hurricane Irma. Support for medical service delivery is provided by: HIMA (Puerto Rico), medical group from Atlanta, and British Government. Medical supplies from HIMA are being stockpiled and will be sent to BVI in small quantities to prevent backlog on the pipeline. Municipal water supply is planned to be restored in one month and the airport is planned to re - open on 18 September for commercial flights. The Ministry of Health will review the WHO Emergency Health Kit and advice regarding needs; the stock may be stored in Barbados due to limited storage space and distributed as needed. In an effort to cope with limited storage space Mobile Storage Units (MSU) are being sent to BVI to increase storage capacity . Limited medical supplies are available; piped water facility is not functional due to l ack of electricity, and limited stock of potable water is available. Response: British naval ship supplied medical supplies and water. PAHO is procuring medical supplies and coordinating logistics for immediate delivery. PAHO technical staff participated in needs and damage assessments, and LSS/SUMA was set up at the airport to receive small shipments. 1,000 doses of tetanus vaccine that were sent from PROMESS warehouse in Haiti through the Dominican Republic has been received and stored in the hospital. CUBA Reports indicate that 516 healthcare facilities have been damaged . Amongst them Hospital Hermanos Ameijeiras , Gyno - Obstetrics America Arias and hospital Universitario Faustino Perez are reported to be partially operational . Six WHO emergency kits are being purchased to support health facilities and restoring access to healthcare to impacted facilities is a priority. Major hospitals in Havana are expected to be up and running by next week. Immediate needs for essential medicines, sanitation, and vector control has been identified. The return of the population to their homes is guided by the Provincial and Municipal Defence Councils, depending on the severity of the damage . 26,000 people remain in shelters. As power is being restored, around 10,000 people remain without electricity. Response: Health authorities are working to restore water supply as well as sanitation systems to avoid disease outbreaks. Restoring power to health centers has been prioritized. 3 SAINT MARTIN AND SAINT BARTHELEMY Security issues have improved, although there remain some challenges in providing protection to the population and distribution of water and food. Saint Martin requested vector control and WASH Supplies, and logistics will be coordinated by PAHO . Desalination plant was heavily damaged by the hurricane , and potable water is available through bottled water . The hospital which is providing emergency and pathology services in Saint Martin is supported by medical staff from Guadeloupe and France . In Saint Barthelemy, the hospital is partially operational and offering some medical services. Water purification tablets for both islands have been identified as needed. Water sources have been tested, and results are pending. A medical waste disposal system need s to be implemented. Response: A shipment of medicine including 200 doses of vaccines is being sent to Saint Martin. Epidemiologists were deployed to Saint Martin and Saint Barthelemy to support surveillance. Mental Health support (CUMP) was mobilized from Martinique to Saint Martin to provide support to persons waiting at the airport for evacuation. 101 medical staff are being mobilized to assist on both islands. SINT MAARTEN In Sint Maarten 91% of building were damaged and the Medical Center is reported to be partially operational . All desalination installations are functional; until the piping system is restored, alternative distribution is needed . General access through roads is goo d and bridges are intact. Restoration of water and sanitation services has the highest priority . Surveillance for infectious diseases is ongoing, especially with reported acute diarrheal cases . The vaccine cold chain on the island has been maintained through the impact of the hurricane. Water safety measures, sanitation supplies, medical supplies and generators have been identified as needed. Response : The Dutch military presence is strong on the island. PAHO is supporting in damage assessments and response coordination including liaison between the hospital and military . A surveillance system was established by the national epidemiologist. TURKS AND CAICOS 80 - 90% of houses severely damaged in Southern Caicos and < 20% of houses damaged in Northern and Middle Caicos. In Providenciales, the Cheshire Hall Medical Center is partially operational and in Grand Turk , Cockburn Town Medical Center is partially operational. Providenciales continues to be without electricity and in Grand Turk due to damage to the airport commercial flights are unavailable. Lack of shelter facilities and sanitation continue to be major concerns. Plans to evacuate South Caicos are ongoing. NEEDS An increase in mosquito and rodent vectors have been reported in heavily impacted islands and vector control has been identified as a priority.  There is need for a surge in human resource capacity to replace the healthcare staff that has been working round the clock since day one. Strengthening capacity in addressing mental health in impacted population, especially those in shelters is important . Repairing damaged health facilities in impacted islands is crucial in managing emergency patients, quick diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and reestablish treatment of non - communicable diseases. Maintaining sanitary conditions, especially in shelters , continues to be a priority. Logistics challenges include restoration of the distribution chain and improvement of well - conditioned storage areas. Security issues are complicating humanitarian response including logistical issues for the islands to receive and distribute basic supplies. There is an estimated 12,000 people on the move from one island to another after the devastation of the hurricane. This could indicate that logistics need to be improved to establish warehouse and distribution chain in order to deliver needed medical supplies, water and food. A quick delivery of needed supplies and human resources will be important in the coming days because the hurricane season continues through November which could mean new tropical storms may be forming in the Atlantic and potentially make its way to the Caribbean. Heightened epidemiological surveillance to support early detection and timely management of disease outbreaks will be important in the coming days due to lack of access to clean water, healthcare and treatment, and increase in vectors and rodents . Some shelters are already reporting diarrheal and skin diseases. Vector - borne - diseases should be prevented by quickly cleaning debris that may create breeding sites when it rains. Environmental Health should also be addressed in these islands as clearing and recovery continues.

Wind, rain and surge waves are causing floods, mudslides and the destruction of homes, schools, health centers and WASH infrastructure, affecting children across the region. After impacting several islands during its path in the Caribbean Sea, Irma was downgraded to Category 3 Saturday morning but was expected to strengthen again over Florida. Hurricane Jose, upgraded to a Category 5, threatened the Leeward Islands and Barbuda, already devastated by Irma . The devastation across the areas has reportedly destroyed as much as 70 - 90% of the infrastructure on some islands. UNICEF is on the ground in the affected countries, working in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Eastern and Western Caribbean islands (Antigua, Anguilla, Barbuda, BVI and TCI) and Haiti, coordinating the response efforts with National Governments and carrying out rapid need assessments and delivering prepositioned supplies. +2.8 million estimated # of children at risk in affected areas; 7 million estimated # of people at risk in the affected areas; 25 fatalities recorded by Saturday morning; +80,000 potentially affected children in Cuba, with 255,000 at risk +19,000 people evacuated and in shelters in Dominican Republic; 132 schools potentially affected in Anguilla, Barbuda, BVI and TCI Islands; +10,000 people in shelters in Haiti. SITUATION IN NUMBERS Reporting period: 6 September 10 September, 2017 10 September 2017 @UNICEF/ UN0119986/Bradley estimated urgent funding needs: US$ 15 million Situation Overview Hurricane Irma continued it s path through the Caribbean today, putting the lives of thousands of children in danger . On Wednesday 6 Sept. , the Category 5 hurricane struck the islands of Antigua, Barbuda, British Virgin Islands (BVI), Anguilla , St. Martin and St. Barts . It reached Dominican Republic (DR), Haiti and Turks & Caicos on Thursday, 7 Sept . Irma made landfall in Cuba Friday evening , still as a Category 5 hurricane , directly hitting to strengthen again over Florida. At least 25 people were confirmed dead by Saturday morning in the islands affected by the storm . Some of the islands in the eastern Caribbean have been totally destroyed, with up to 90% of the buildings affected. Scores of people have been displaced from their homes arrival. UNICEF staff are on the ground, working in close coordination with each government and implementing partners , evaluating the most urgent needs for children and adolescents. Humanitarian Leadership and Coordination National response to the emergency is led by each National Government and their respective sectorial Ministries . UNICEF COs are actively participating in coordination meetings and providing technical assistance. In Cuba, a CERF request is being prepared with focus on Education, Health and WASH. This will include early childhood development, education and recreation activities. UNICEF Eastern Caribbean Office is fully engaged with the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) response mechanism to conduct the first need rapid assessment. A joint CERF request is under elaboration in coordination with the RO. UNICEF Dominican Republic, as a part of UNETE, has offered support to the Government , and the WASH Group has been activated in the capital and in the northern region of the country. UNICEF could also request CERF funding , depending on the assessment of the humanitarian impact. In Haiti, a joint helicopter assessment was undertaken by humanitarian actors, government partners and donors to assess damage.  Sectorial/Intersectorial assessments were also done in Centre, North, Northeast and Northwest departments under governmental leadership. UNICEF LACRO has taken part in regional coordination meetings led by OCHA , where sector actions and operation mechanisms for the response are being analyzed and agreed upon. OCHA has announced the intention to go ahead with a Regional Response Plan for some of the countries affected by the Hurricane. Summary Analysis by Country Cuba Irma made landfall in Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, impacting the island for more than 48 hours with sustained winds of 250 kilometre s per hour. It changed its course from north to west during Friday, with strong winds and rains affecting over 800 kms of national territory. The provinces most affected are Ciego de Avila, Santis Spiritus, Villa Clara and Camaguey. Flooding has affected the coastal areas of Matanzas, Mayabeque and La Havana with over six meter waves and tropical storm winds of over 70 kms per hour, causing preventive cuts to basic services , including power, water and gas. The number of potentially affected municipalities m ay reach 17 , making it likely that the number of potentially affected children will increase from the first estimates of 40,000 to 100,000. This number may continue to rise. . UNICEF Response 3 million chlorine tablets have been allocated for distribution to 40 - 50,000 people . The CERF request is being prepared with a focus on Education, Health and WASH with specific supplies to support early childhood development, education and recreation activities. Gaps and needs When Irma has cleared Cuba and weather conditions allow , a n assessment will need to be conducted to identify needs . Dominican Republic (DR) Irma passed by the Dominican Republic as a Category 5 on September 7 , which resulted in more than 50 aqueducts and water infrastructure affected , 10 communities with no means of communication, and over 1.6 million people at risk, including 654,600 children under 18 years of age at the greatest risk.  Over 19,000 people have been evacuated to shelters , and 20 schools are currently being used as shelters for displaced people . Based on the current information , the most affected provinces are Samaná, Montecristi, Puerto Plata and María Trinidad Sánchez. UNICEF Response Prior to the arrival of the hurricane, UNICEF, with the Emergency Operations Center , disseminated key messages about preparedness through social media networks. As of September 6, these message s have been seen 18 million times. Through the nutrition resilience group, UNICEF has called on humanitarian partners to avoid the distribution of baby formula and other substitutes for breast milk. As a part of the disaster preparedness actions with the MoE, a guidance has been provided to teachers and psychologists in schools to effectively deal with children affected by the emergency. Gaps and Needs Initial estimates call for the distribution of 3,000 hygiene kits, 5,000 plastic jerry cans and 100 water tank s for the affected population , as well as 30,000 ORS in preparation for an increase in diarrhea cases. It is essential to ensure psychosocial support and care for children in the most affected communities an d for girls and boys in shelters and to advocate for the prevention of violence, especially sexual violence, in affected communities and shelters through the Young UNICEF partner volunteers. Efforts must be made to engage the affected population in response strategies and tools to ensure that all children and adolescents living in the affected areas can be protected, are healthy and have access to education and participation spaces. Eastern Caribbean Area (ECA) Residents of Barbuda, Anguilla, British Virgin Islands (BVI) and Turks & Caicos (TCI) Islands are preparing for the arrival of Hurricane Jose. In Barbuda, the mandatory evacuation is ongoing. It is estimated that up to 800 of the 1,200 residents have been evacuated to shelters in Antigua. Approximately 132 schools are damaged in the most affected territories . 5 Airports in Barbuda and Anguilla remain out of service due to high levels of damage. It is estimated that more than 19,000 children are at risk, including 5,000 children at high risk . Other overseas territories such as St . Martin and St . Barts have also been severely impacted. A UNICEF Rapid Response Team has been deployed in Antigua Island to ensure rapid and efficient operations for BVI, Anguilla and Barbuda , while TCI response will continue to be handled from Barbados CO. UNICEF Response Water purifications tablets were given to the National Emergency Office in Antigua for Barbuda evacuees . In addition, UNICEF pre - positioned emergency supplies in Antigua (tents, tarpaulins, water purification tables, etc.) have been distributed in coordination with national authorities. A UNICEF WASH Specialist was deployed to Barbuda and Antigua to conduct an initial need s assessment as a part of the UNDAC team for Anguilla . In addition, two UNICEF ECA Specialist s have be en deploy ed to Turks & Caicos Islands and one to BVI. More than 3,000 flyers have been produced with key messages on handwashing and Child Protection to be distributed within the next days. In addition, UNICEF has produced radio spots on health , hygiene, breastfeeding and child protection in emergencies. Teams from the non - affected islands are being mobilized for psychosocial care and support activities in partnership with the Organization of the Eastern Caribbean Office.  The first group of children to benefit from this effort will be evacuees from Barbuda based in Antigua. Shelter and WASH supplies are being mobilized to TCI where the impact is reported to be very high , given the low - lying islands. Gaps and Needs Deployment of relief teams, shipment of supplies and communications are hampered by inoperable airports and rough seas, especially with the impending arrival of Hurricane Jose. There is an urgent need for basic shelter and WASH supplies such as tarpaulins , blankets, water containers or hygiene kits. They will be shipped from the Panama regional and Supply Division stocks. Initial assessments reveal that up to 100 unaccompanied children arrived in Antigua from Barbuda. Care givers have been mobilized through the Department of Social Care, but close follow - up of the situation must be ensured . An education needs assessment including school infrastructure is required to ensure a rapid and safe return to education activities. Haiti Irma passed north of the coast of Haiti on Friday 8 September, bringing lower level s of damage than originally anticipated. A Northwest experienced partial flooding. Preliminary assessments suggest that while there are around 10,000 people in shelters, the vast majority are there as a result of pre - hurricane evacuation procedures. The government is encouraging families to return home as soon as possible so that schools can recommence. Many have already started re turning home. UNICEF Response Stocks including hygiene kits, blankets, schools in a box and chlorination supplies were prepositioned for approximately 10,000 in advance of Hurricane Irma, taking into consideration lessons learned from Hurricane Matthew . UNICEF multi - sectoral teams were also prepositioned in several locations. Two contingency PCAs were activated, with Oxfam and ACF (Action Against Hunger) . Assistance is being provided by humanitarian partners and government at local levels and for vulnerable families according to needs assessments currently underway. The MIRA multi-sectoral assessment tool has been validated by the Government . Gaps and needs Rapid assessments are underway to understand needs and the number of children who need aid. Human resource needs have been identified in operations, global protection coordination and human resources, which are being filled with roster deployments. The HCT has determined that , given the level of impact and the existing capacity , there will not be a CERF application or Flash Appeal launched. Regional Actions include: UNICEF has mobilized 10 rapid response members from its regional and global response mechanisms . The Regional Rapid Response Roster and additional humanitarian personnel are ready for deployment to countries where support is required . The UNICEF Regional Office has been mobilized and is supporting the affected country offices with technical assistance, tools and reference materials for the response. WASH : WASH LAC is coordinating the response with WASH Group in DR and PAHO and advising on needed supplies to respond to the first phase of the emergency in Cuba. Water quality and inadequate hygiene habits due to lack of access to basic and adequate WASH services are concerns. Education : The regional office is in permanent communication with the COs in DR, Haiti, ECA and Cuba to identify the main education needs in terms of coordination, technical assistance, HHRR, supplies and tools. EiE reference materials have been sent to support the preparation of Education and ECD response. Child Protection : UNICEF RO has been communicating with Child Protection colleagues in DR, Haiti, Cuba and ECA to provide required support in preparation , response and eventual deployments. Health & Nutrition : There are no current request of support from LACRO in the Nutrition sector. While some countries are prepared or in contact with the Global Nutrition Cluster, others do not address Nutrition in the first phase of emergency. However, LACRO is in con tact with Health and Nutrition specialist s to be alert to possible health risks . The situation may rapidly deteriorate (outbreaks of diarrhea followed by a rise of acute malnutrition cases) if no preventive actions are taken to protect and support infant and young child feeding practices ; ongoing monitoring is required. Supply & Logistics : UNICEF is providing a first delivery of humanitarian supplies to the most affected zones in coordination with national governments. US$250,000 worth of life saving supplies is being sent within the next days. Communications and Media : Three press releases, six blogposts, two videos and a number of interviews have been disseminated to show the impact of Hurricane Irma and UNICEF preparedness work. These are all available for download on a dedicated site on the website. Social media has been used for three purposes: stay safe messages to those affected, communication on the impact and UNICEF work , and fundraising . Communication to engage communities (C4D) Guidance and tools for rapid assessments, key messages and the communication in humanitarian action tool kit has been shared with C o s . U - Report Social Mobilization : Over 12,500 joined U - Report in 72 hours to receive stay - safe messages before the hurricane. Over 1,20 0 individual questions have been responded to in U - Report before, during and after the hurricane. U - Report is being used to support assessment of needs via bespoke polls sent to U - Reporters in each country or island affected. Fundraising: The RO prepared a regional appeal shared with all National Committees and Latin America and Caribbean Country Offices as of Wednesday .

Having caused large scale damage in parts of the Eastern Caribbean, the storm passed by the Dominican Republic and Haiti before slowly moving along the coast of Cuba for over 48 hours, fluctuating between a category 4 and 5 hurricane. With high winds, heavy rain and storm surges it has caused widespread damage to homes, schools, health centres and basic infrastructure across the region. Barbuda was evacuated in advance of Hurricane Jose. Fortunately, the hurricane turned north out to sea, and did not cause further damage to the Eastern Caribbean as feared Anguilla, Barbuda, British Virgin Islands (BVI) and Turks & Caicos islands (TVI) bore the brunt of Irma in the Eastern Caribbean Dominican Republic and Haiti report lower than anticipated damage, but assessments are still underway Widespread flooding is reported in Cuba . The current assessments indicate unfortunate death of 10 people and a vast majority of the island without power .

Between Wednesday 6 and Sunday 10 September, the hurricane caused large scale damage to infrastructure across the Eastern Caribbean islands of Anguilla , Barbuda , British Virgin Islands (BVI), St Maarten /St Martin (both Dutch and French sides of the island), US Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos, Cuba , and the Bahamas , before moving to Florida on Sunday . At least 25 people were confirmed dead by Sunday evening, and this number is expected to rise. Haiti and the Dominican Republic were spared the full force of Irma, though assessments are still underway to assess needs. Widespread flooding is reported in Cuba, with much of the island without power or communication. Immediate emergency needs are reported in Turks and Caicos, especially Grand Turk, the island that houses the capital. UNICEF staff are on the ground, working in close coordination with each government and implementing partners , evaluating the most urgent needs for children and adolescent s. Humanitarian Leadership and Coordination National response to the emergency is led by each National Government and their respective sectorial Ministries . UNICEF COs continue to actively participating in coordination meetings and providing technical assistance. o In Cuba, a CERF request is being prepared with focus on Education, WASH and Health. This will include early childhood development, education and recreation activities. o UNICEF Eastern Caribbean Office is fully engaged with the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) response mechanism to conduct the first need rapid assessment. o UNICEF Dominican Republic, as a part of UNETE, has offered support to the Government and the WASH Group has been activated in the capital and in the northern region of the country. UNICEF LACRO has taken part in regional coordination meetings led by OCHA where sector actions and operation mechanisms for the response are being analyzed and agreed. OCHA has announced the intention to prepare a Regional Response Plan for some the countries affected by the Hurricane. UNICEF Eastern Caribbean Office is coordinating closely with all local authorities, including those of the affected British Overseas Territories which are considered under the Eastern Caribbean Multi - Country Programme (British Virgin Islands, Turks & Caicos Islands and Anguilla). The islands being part of the Kingdom of The Netherlands and part of France are receiving direct support from the government of The Netherlands and of France. Where requested, UNICEF LACRO is providing advice to the UNICEF NatComs. Summary Analysis by CO Cuba Irma made landfall in Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane on Friday evening, and did not leave until Sunday morning, causing the unfortunate loss of 10 human lives and widespread damage as per the latest assessments . Serious flooding is reported on much of the island, including Havana , Guantanamo and Holguin . Services and telecommunication have been lost in large parts of the island, including Caletones . Power outage s and severe damage is reported in the coastal community of Yumuri. 78 medical brigades were deployed and 43 hospitals and polyclinics are providing essential health services with special focus on protecting pregnant women. The scale of damage and number of affected children and families is unknown. Three thermos - electrics are affected, which may in turn affect water and pumping systems . Over 2 million people have been evacuated to 1,134 shelters or to houses of neighbours and relatives. In the capital Havana it is estimated that 23,000 people have been affected of which 14,000 have been evacuated. The principal hospital of Hermanos Ameijeiras has reported flooding, but with no major damage. It is estimated that 900,000 people have been directly affected across 22 municipalities, in 13 provinces of the island. UNICEF CO Response A draft CERF request was prepared prior to the hurricane strike and is being updated considering the scale of the damage caused by Irma, with a focus on Education, Health and WASH . This will include specific supplies to support early childhood development, education and recreation activities. Gaps and needs The difficulty in communicating with Cuba means the scale of damage is currently uncertain. There is no clear specific analysis for children yet. However, the damage to schools and the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services may put the lives of many children at risk in the country. Dominican Republic (DR) The damage to Dominican Republic was far less than initially feared and no fatalities have been reported thus far . At the north of the country. Schools classes (public and private) have restarted on Monday 11 September . for children requires continuous monitoring, especially with regards to basic water and sanitation services for children . UNICEF CO Response UNICEF, in coordination with the Ministry of Education, will participate in evaluation missions to the field that have been programmed under the framework of UNETE. UNICEF , jointly with the UN agencies and COE (National Emergency Committee) , has initiated the field assessment in the most affected provinces: Samaná, Puerto Plata, Montecristi and Maria Trinidad Sánchez. UNICEF partner organisations and volunteers of have offered assistance to work with UNICEF in the prevention of violence against children , especially sexual and gender based violence, in Puerto Plata, Samaná and Monte Cristi, which are the communities affected by the emergency and related displacements of population . Eastern Caribbean Area (ECA) Clean up efforts continue in Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands, which all sustained severe damage during the passage of Hurricane Irma. Nearly all of the 1,600 residents of Barbuda, were successfully evacuated to Antigua before Hurricane Jose and are in temporary shelter in a stadium. In St Kitts and Nevis there are reports of damage to healthcare facilities. Telecommunications are disrupted in many of the islands including Barbados. The logistics of moving assessment and response teams, as well as supplies, to the multiple islands affected across the northern Leeward Island chain has been a major challenge. There are concerns for lack of safe and clean water. UNICEF CO Response Focus of UNICEF response in Eastern Caribbean is on Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos islands. Prepositioned UNICEF stocks have been immediately made available for distribution to children and families evacuated from Barbuda. The supplies included tents, school - in - a - box and recreation kits for 300 to 400 children . - on Wednesday (Sep 13). This activity will be implemented in partnership with the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States Commission and the Ministries of Social Transformation and Education in Antigua and Barbuda. Tarpaulins for shelters, blankets, jerry cans, water purification tablets, and large water collapsible containers are being mobilized from the Pan ama pre - positioned stocks to Turks and Caicos Islands ( TCI ) where the impact of the Irma is reported to be significant given the low - lying islands. A flight with supplies is planned this week to TCI. The UNICEF focus on TCI was agreed with the CDEMA coordinated response, also taking into consideration efforts of the UK Government and planned provision of similar supplies to Anguilla and British Virgin Islands ( BVI ) . The northern liaison unit of two UNICEF East Caribbean Area Office ( ECA ) staff has be en established in Antigua . This unit will liaise with the CDEMA hub for a coordinated rapid and efficient deployment and supply receipt and distribution to all affected northern islands focusing on Anguilla, Barbuda and British Virgin Islands . A Supply Division Logistics specialist will join the unit to provide support and facilitate local sourcing of supplies to help reinvigorate the economies of impacted countries. Two UNICEF ECA Specialists were deployed to TCI via Kingston, Jamaica which is the sub - regional staging point for assistance to TCI and the Bahamas. They will arrive in Providenciales early this week Caribbean rapid assessment and response team. Education section identified possible candidates to support ECA emergency education and ECD response and have prepared a profile shar ed with CO for rapid deployment . The RO also provided technical support and tools for the preparation of the ECD response plan. A media team from UNICEF headquarters and the regional office for Latin America and the Caribbean is in the field in Antigua starting from 10 September and will also be deployed to TCI and other islands. Joint Action Planning with the UN System in Barbados has been started for the next stage of humanitarian response and recovery. Gaps and Needs To date there is no detailed time - frame for the return of the evacuated people from the island of Barbuda that have been evacuated to Antigua . Most of the people are staying with family or friend s, while an estimated 300 people are staying in shelters. The geographical spread of the islands and still problematic access to the most affected areas is still hampering assessments Haiti Damage to Haiti from Irma was lower than originally anticipated. The most exposed areas were the three northern departments of Nord - Ouest, Nord and Nord - Est, and to a certain extent Centre and Artibonite, which are prone to flooding. The red alert has been issued for the whole territory following the passage of hurricane Irma as it led to flooding, falling of trees, and damage on buildings and agriculture. Heavy rains stopped early in the morning of Friday 8th September and the meteorological situation resumed to normal. Emergency response coordination fora (COUN and COUD) were activated at national and departmental level on September 6th The DPC (Division of Civil Protection) ensure the coordination to conduct rapid assessments and multi - sectoral teams and contingency stocks were on standby in the Northern departments. Contingency agreements, signed ahead of the cyclonic season, were activated with OXFAM and ACF. According to the DPC, 22 communes in the departments of North East, North West, North, Centre, Artibonite and West have been partially flooded. 9,748 people were evacuated to 55 temporary shelter in these departments and many more were evacuated to host families. School activities are resuming starting on Monday 11 September. UNICEF CO Response Water - trucking and provision of water tanks, water purification tablets and water containers for the population in shelters. In Ouanaminthe, six handwashing points were installed. Door - to - door sensitization was undertaken by community mobilizers in Ouanaminthe, Malfety, and Ferrier. materials and family hygiene kits. Improved surveillance and rapid response to cholera alerts, focusing on access to sustainable water and sanitation in the most affected areas, as well as through strengthening community - based surveillance. Schools used as temporary shelters are currently been cleaned and disinfected to resumed schooling activities. Contingency stocks of schools kits will be distributed shortly to the schools affected by the floods. Gaps and needs Rapid assessments are underway to understand better the needs and number of children who may need assistance. As the hurricane season is still ongoing, the replenishment of the contingency stocks which have been used to respond to specific needs in in the affect ed areas should be reconstitute and it is important to remember that there is still as significant shortfall in funding for the ongoing Humanitarian Response Plan. Initial assessments indicate that several water systems have been damaged by the Hurricane and should be fixed to resume access to water to the concerned communities. Several schools have been damaged and rehabilitation work would be required and reequipped with benches and tables. Monitoring and care for the unaccompanied children and affected families. Regional Actions include: UNICEF Regional Office is supporting the work on a n Interagency Regional Action Plan for various countries in the Caribbean . UNICEF Regional Office has been communicating with all the country offices affected to provide technical assistance, o Education: Review of the first draft of the CERF for Cuba and updated the references for the Education - ECD supplies required.
